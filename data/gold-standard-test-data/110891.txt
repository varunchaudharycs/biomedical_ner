PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- Mrs. [**Known lastname 13755**] initially presented [**2143-9-2**] with abdominal

pain. At that time, she was found to have a large mass in her
abdomen.
- On [**2143-9-6**], she underwent an incomplete resection of this
tumor. It was found to be increasing in size and she was treated

on Gleevec from [**1-/2145**] to 12/[**2146**]. At that time, she stopped it

as she was having some side effects from this therapy, most
notably severe cramping. On the Gleevec, her tumor had decreased

in size. However, the mass grew while she was off the Gleevec
and she was restarted on it again in 07/[**2149**]. She was restarted

at 200mg daily to avoid issues with cramping.
- On [**2151-6-29**] she had a CT scan which showed new liver lesions
which were concerning. An ultrasound was obtained [**2151-7-13**] which

showed these lesions and raised concern for metastatic disease.

- She was increased from Gleevec 200mg daily to 400mg daily on
[**2151-9-8**].
- She had stable CT scans and the liver lesions were determined

to be cysts, she was decreased from 400mg daily to 200mg daily
due to nausea on [**2152-4-5**].
-CT scan [**10/2152**] there was increase in size of a right upper
mesenteric nodule with no other enlarging disease. Her case was
discussed previously and surgery is an option. At this time she
is interested in trying 400mg Gleevec to see if this
controls/shrinks this mass. If the mass continues to enlarge she
would consider surgery.
