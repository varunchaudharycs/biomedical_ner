Brief Hospital Course:
1. ANAPHYLAXIS TO BACTRIM:
Patient developed fever/tachycardia/hypotension on hospital
day#2; initial suspicion for sepsis syndrome, however blood
cultures remained negative and hemodynamic recovery achieved
with massive fluid resuscitation in the ICU - of note, patient
had received dose of Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis preceding his
hypotension.  A diffuse rash was transiently noted in the ICU.
Upon return to the floor, he received an additional dose of
Bactrim - with recurrence of fever/tachycardia/hypotension,
again requiring ICU stay for massive fluid resuscitation.
Although no airway compromise was noted in either case, there is
certainty based on stereotyped reaction immediately following
Bactrim exposure that patient experiences anaphylactic-type
reaction to Bactrim, which has since been listed as a serious
allergy.
.
2. cellulitis/abscess - R forearm wound culture grew MSSA. Pt
was initially started on vanco and linezolid in MICU to
empirically cover MRSA and toxin production, changed to
oxacillin and clindamycin per ID recs after sensitivy
inforamation available.  Surgery drained the wound and packed
with wet to dry dressings changed tid.  Erythema over R forearm
decreased over stay in MICU. Pain controlled with prn morphine
in MICU.
- on the floor, pt's erythema around the site improved slowly.
Surgery removed the wick. and started wet to dry dressings.
- per ID, Use Oxacillin for MSSA coverage and Clinda, which is a
protein synthesis inhibitor, for prevention of toxin production,
initially.  After 5 days clinda was stopped and pt was switched
over to Diclox PO and sent home with PO antibiotics.
-Pt will f/u with Surgery in 1 wk of discharge.
- ID will f/u on TSST toxin.
.
3. "rash" - in MICU pt became pink throughout the body/face. ?
drug reaction versus bacterial toxin.  We infused vanco slowly
(over 2 hours) in case of red man syndrome. Also decided to hold
Bactrim in case allergy.  The following day the pt appeared less
pink and it the etiology thus remains unclear.
- Once stable pt was given bactrim 1000mg SS.  Pt became
hypotensive and needed to be admitted the ICU again, so this
likely anaphylactic reaction.
.
4. HIV/AIDS - CD4 11 as of [**6-4**], viral load 4320 as of [**6-4**]. pt
not on HAART because of non-compliance. Per ID recs did NOT
start on HAART in hospital but will recommend follow up as
outpatient to do so.  Had started pt on Bactrim as prophylaxis
but stopped after two days after pt's skin became pink all over
in case of allergic rx.
-Would not use Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis in this pt. Per ID
may use dapsone 100 mg po Daily after G6PD results come back
negative
-No azithromycin for now for MAC prophylaxis as ID concerned
that he may already have disseminated MAC.
-f/u Mycolytic cultures in [**Hospital **] clinic and if neg can start on
azithromycin
- Pt. will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic.
