[**2113-3-22**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXIL:
1. Numerous facial fractures as enumerated before corresponding
most closely to a Le Fort type III on the left and
anterior,lateral and superior walls of the maxillary sinus on
the right including the inferior orbital rim.
2. Hemorrhage contained within the maxillary sinuses.
3. Chronic non-displaced fracture of the tip of the dens.

[**2113-3-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
Small right apical pneumothorax at the level of the second
posterior
interspace, slightly smaller than on [**3-26**]. Small right
pleural effusion has probably developed. Lungs low in volume but
clear. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Healed right lower and
lateral rib fractures.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary of Injuries sustained: anterior right 2-7th rib
fractures, right hemopneumothorax, bilateral pulmonary
contusions, L zygomatic arch fracture, left lateral pterygoid
plate fractures, left lateral orbital wall fractures, left
minimally displaced orbital fractures, nondisplaced lamina
papyrica fracture, right orbital floor fracture, bilateral
lateral wall maxillary sinus fracture, right ear skin avulsion.

Review of Systems:

Neurologic: Patient was neurologically intact. He recieved
dilaudid IV prn during his ICU stay, he was then transitioned to
PO pain medication. At discharge he was not requiring pain
medication.  Opthalmology assessed patient to assess visual
status following displaced orbital fractures.  Plastic surgery
assessed facial fractures and as patient is refusing surgery,
they will follow up with him as an outpatient. For his facial
fractures he was placed under sinus precautions and is
restricted to a soft diet.Neurosurgery assessed patient for his
dens fracture and it was determined that his fracture resulted
from an injury 20 years ago when he dove into a pool. On
hospital day 6 he was triggered for altered mental status after
receiving valium.  Standing zyprexa was administered with return
to baseline mental status without further incidient.  He
requires no further neurosurgical follow-up for his dens
fracture.

Cardiovascular: Following transfer to the ICU patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  He suffered an intial period of
hypotension in the emergency room but after resuscitation he was
hemodynamically stable.

Pulmonary: A chest tube was placed for hemopneumothorax in the
ED. The chest tube was discontinued on HD6. There was a small
increase in pneumothorax upon discontinuation, however follow up
CXR revealed this change to be stable. His respiratory status
was stable.  While in the ICU, he was monitored for respiratory
decompensation due to splinting from his rib fractures, however
his respiratory status remained stable and he did not require an
epidural for pain control.

GI: Patient suffered no intraabdominal injury. He tolerated a
soft diet without issue. He was restricted to a soft diet due to
his facial fractures.

GU/Renal: Patient has a foley catheter placed while in the ICU
but it was discontinued when he was transferred to the floor.
His electrolytes were repleted as necessary. His creatinine
remained stable.

Endocrine: He was placed on insulin sliding scale while in the
ICU. At discharge sliding scale had be discontinued and patient
was no longer requiring insulin. A right thyroid nodule was
noted on CT and needs to be followed up with ultrasound as an
outpatient,

Heme: Patient underwent serial hematocrit checks which trended
down slowly. He received one blood transfusion while in
hospital, after which he required no further transfusions as his
hematocrit was stable.  He was placed on SQH for DVT
prophylaxis.

Skin: Patient right ear laceration was repaired primarily by
plastic surgery. He was placed on levofloxacin, which following
treatment course, was discontinued.
