History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7518**] is an 85 y/o male with COPD, HTN, AF on
coumadin admitted to NEBH [**2-8**] with atrial fibrillation s/p CV
developed tachy/brady syndrome s/p AF ablation on [**2-14**]
discharged on CCB, metoprolol and dofetilide now presents with
presyncope and sinus bradycardia. On [**2-14**] patient underwent EP
study which showed several atrial tachycardias and two were
ablated. The plan was for cardioversion following ablation but
patient converted to NSR and remained in NSR with only 2 brief
episodes of AF on telemetry. Since discharge from the hospital
on [**2-15**] the patient has been feeling well. He has not had any
chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness until this morning.
This AM had minimal appetite at breakfast. Then attempted to
have a bowel movement several times with straining and each time
felt lightheaded and dizzy with associated diaphoresis. He has
been constipated over the past four days. His children were with
him, helped him back to bed and called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who referred him
to the Emergency Room. The patient did not ever lose
consciousness. He reports that he has been complaint with all of
his medications. He denies any associated chest pain or
shortness of breath. Patient has history of bradycardia in past
when on metoprolol and cardizem (HR ranging from 40-100 bpm).
.
During the patient's last hospitalization he underwent AF
ablation however according to d/c summary only 2 of 4
arrhythmias were ablated. He was in sinus rhythm prior to
discharge and was discharged on lopressor, cardizem and
dofetilide.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR: 45-55 BP: 78/39, O2sat 96% on
RA. Exam notable for patient with good mentation. EKG was
initially sinus bradycardia. Patient received 2 g Calcium
gluconate and 1L IVF. Symptoms and EKG changes felt to be
consistent with too much medication.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient feels "better". He is
fatigued but overall improved from this afternoon. HR 50s. BP
111/70. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
cough, abdominal pain, orthopnea, ankle edema and PND. He does
report some persistent groin pain, R>L which has improved over
the past several days.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 85 year old male with history of AF s/p CV at OSH
with resultant tachy/brady s/p AF ablation on [**2-14**] started on
dofetilide, CCB and beta blocker now presents with presyncope
and bradycardia likely related to medication. Now off dilt and
metoprolol and on dofetilide and acebutolol with symptomatic
improvement. This hospitalization is complicated by ongoing fall
in HCT with expansion of his bilat groin hematomas R>L now s/p r
hematoma evacuation.
.
## Bilateral groin hematomas: He had bilateral groin hematomas,
and had a hematocrit drop betwee his ablation and this admission
from about 30 --> 24. He had groin ultrasound that showed
bilateral hematomas but no pseudoaneurysm. S/p drainage and
hematoma evacuation by vascular surgery [**2135-2-20**]. Now with one JP
drain in place. Pt denies pain. No transfusions since [**2-21**].
Following vascular recs, he will follow up in 2 weeks with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. HCT remained stable at time of discharge.
.
## Rhythm: He does have AF s/p CV c/b bradycardia and
tachycardia recently here for AF ablation on [**2-14**] with 2 of 4
atrial arrhythmias ablated. Discharged on [**2-15**] on Dofetelide,
Cardizem and Metoprolol in normal sinus rhythm. Returns with
near syncopal episodes and sinus bradycardia, likely medication
related. Symptoms are likely exacerbated in setting of anemia.
Cardizem and metoprolol discontinued and he was discahrged on
acebutolol and dofetilide for rate and rhythm control which he
tolerated. HOLD coumadin with lovenox for now pending HCT
stabilization. Should be restarted at follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of vascular surgery. He was monitored on telemetry.
.
## Pump: Patient with known history of CHF per chart. Euvolemic
on exam.  Monitored I/Os, goal even.
.
## CAD: No known CAD. No ischemic sxs currently.
.
## Cellulitis: Pt had mild erythema R groin near well-healing
incision. had low grade fever with pancultures sent.  He was
started on cephalexin to complete 10 day course. His culture
data had no growth at time of discharge and he remained
afebrile>48 hours prior to discharge.
.
## Anemia: Likely related to blood loss in groin based on exam
findings of bilateral hematomas. Baseline approximately 30.
Tranfused total 6 units. Last transfused [**2135-2-21**].  Continue iron
supplementation, B12. Mgmt as above for hematomas.
.
## GERD: Continued ppi
.
## COPD: Continued inhalers
