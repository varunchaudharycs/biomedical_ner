CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old female who
was transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with a known TAA who
presented with a heart rate in the 40s, blood pressures in
the 70s.  A CT was done which showed fusiform TAA with
contained rupture at the SMA.  Creatinine was elevated at
1.9, baseline 0.9.  The patient denied any symptoms.  The
patient was transferred here for further treatment and
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD O2 dependent, pulmonary
hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 77, steroid
dependent COPD, current tobacco user, history of coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction, history of
transitional cell renal cell carcinoma status post left
nephrectomy, history of spinal canal surgery status post
lumbar surgery, history of GERD, history of depression,
history of steroid myopathy, history of anal squamous cell
carcinoma status post chemotherapy and radiation, history of
type 2 diabetes controlled, history of carotid disease status
post left CEA, status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis status post left carotid
endarterectomy, osteoarthritis status post right hip
replacement, squamous cell carcinoma anal status post
radiation and chemotherapy, status post transitional cell
carcinoma status post left nephrectomy radical.  History of
COPD with pulmonary hypertension, O2 dependent, steroid
dependent.  Right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.  Current
smoker.  Type 2 diabetes noninsulin-dependent controlled.
History of spinal canal stenosis status post lumbar surgery.
History of GERD.  History of coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction.  History of steroid myopathy.
History of pulmonary hypertension.  Status post total
abdominal hysterectomy, status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission Lipitor 10 mg daily, sertraline
100 mg daily, tizanidine 4 mg q.i.d., Spirolactone 25 mg
daily, Toprol XL 50 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily,

[**5-/2076**] 1 puff b.i.d., DuoNeb treatments 4 times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Current smoker of a pack per day.  The
patient lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 59, respirations
17, O2 sat 91% on 6 liters nasal cannula, blood pressure
154/76.  General appearance:  In no acute distress; oriented
x3.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop
or rub.  Breath sounds are diminished at the bases
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended.  A
well-healed left flank incision.  Abdominal aorta not
prominent.  Pulse exam shows palpable femoral and pedal
pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the intensive
care unit.  CT surgery was requested to see the patient.  The
patient underwent CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with
reconstruction and 3-D imaging.  The chest portion showed
extensive emphysema changes throughout both lungs.  There was
an 8.2 x 6.7 mm nodular density in the right upper lobe.
There is atelectasis present in the base.  There were several
large intrathoracic mediastinal nodes.  There were several
scattered sub centimeter mediastinal lymph nodes.  CT of the
abdomen with and without contrast revealed the left kidney
was absent.  There is free fluid in the upper abdomen
surrounding liver and spleen.  The pancreas is atrophic.  The
right renal gland and right renal kidney appear unremarkable.
The pelvis CT with and without contrast revealed streaked
artifacts and bilateral hip replacements.  Diverticular
disease in the sigmoid colon without evidence of
diverticulitis.  There is no significant pelvic
lymphadenopathy.  Musculoskeletal shows degenerative changes
present in the lumbar spine as well as a well defined
sclerotic focus in the left iliac bone most likely a bone
island.  CT of the abdomen with extensive atherosclerotic
disease of the aorta and its branches.  The right and left
coronary arteries arise from a normal expected anatomical
location.  The descending aorta at the level of the right
main pulmonary artery is 38 x 38 mm.  There is extensive
concentric noncalcification plaque present in the descending
thoracic and abdominal aortas.  There are multiple ulcerative
plaques throughout the entire course of the descending aorta.
The descending aorta at the level of the left inferior
pulmonary vein measures 42.2 x 37.4 mm.  The abdominal aorta
in the upper abdomen above the celiac access measures 37.3 x
49.3 mm.  The celiac access, superior mesenteric artery are
widely patent.  Inferior mesenteric artery was not clear to
visualize.  There is an abdominal aortic aneurysm that
measures 63.5 x 65.1 mm in maximum transverse diameter.
There is a 24 x 24.6 mm right common iliac aneurysm which
contains concentric mural thrombus.  CT surgery was consulted
after review of the CT scan.  In discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]
and CT surgery Dr. __________ it was determined the patient
was not a surgical candidate because of extensive medical
problems, respiratory problems.  The patient was made DNR,
DNI.  Blood pressure medications were adjusted to stabilize
blood pressure.  The patient was transferred out of the ICU
to the regular nursing floor on [**2133-9-9**].  The patient was
discharged to home with well controlled blood pressure
without any symptoms.  The patient's creatinine at discharge
was 1.1.  The patient should follow up with the primary care
physician for continued blood pressure monitoring and blood
pressure medication adjustment.  She should call primary care
if she develops any chest, back, abdominal pain or near
syncopal episodes.
