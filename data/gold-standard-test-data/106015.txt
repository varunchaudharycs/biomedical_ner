72M with pmh significant for metastatic rectal cancer was at
radiology clinic receiving scheduled imaging when blood pressure
at triage recorded 60/40. Recheck was 70/40. His port was
accessed and he was bolused with 300cc of IVF and transferred to
the ED. He denied syncope or lightheadedness but reported mild
SOB and fatigue. He reports having several days of diahrrea,
which began last wednesday [**4-14**]. His last dose of irinotecan and
panitumab chemotherapy was Monday [**2134-3-29**] (patient reports was
[**4-12**] but not recorded in OMR), and he reports always getting
diahrrea with his chemotherapy. He reports haveing watery bowel
movements roughly every 45 minutes since wednesday. HIs bowel
movements are not bloody or melanaic. He has been taking
immodium and diphenoxylate-atropine without improvement. Sunday
night, he reports acute worsening of his diahrrea, which
continued through Monday. EMS gave him another 500cc of NS prior
to arrival to the ED.

melena.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Adenocarcinoma of the rectum
- [**6-/2131**]:  The patient presented with a change in bowel habits
and was noted to have an abnormal rectal exam by his primary
care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 39262**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] gastrointestinal evaluation.
- [**2131-7-23**] colonoscopy:  Exophytic cancer of the rectum [**9-9**]
cm
above the anal margin.  Polyp noted at the anorectal junction.
Biopsy:  Invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
arising in association with adenoma. Polyp:  Adenoma with
high-grade dysplasia.
- [**2131-7-25**] rectal ultrasound:  T3 posterior midline tumor with
luminal narrowing of the rectum.
- [**2131-8-2**] CT scan of the torso:  Irregular, polypoid lesion
seen within the rectum, with multiple subcentimeter presacral
and
pericolic lymph nodes identified.  Two pulmonary nodules seen in
the left lower lobe, the largest measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm.
Multiple
low-attenuation lesions seen within the liver, the
largest of which may represent cyst, smaller lesions are not
fully characterized.  Low-attenuation lesions seen within the
left kidney, possibly a cyst, although too small to
characterize.
Per report, a CT PET performed elsewhere demonstrated uptake in
the left base of the lung.
- [**2131-8-14**] to [**2131-9-25**]:  Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with
continuous 5-FU at 225 mg/m2/day and radiation therapy five days
weekly.
- [**2131-12-10**]:  Proctosigmoidectomy with stapled coloanal
anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.  Pathology revealed
adenocarcinoma of the rectum, low-grade, with invasion into the
perirectal adipose tissue and metastasis to 7 of 13 regional
lymph nodes (T3N2).  The resection margins were uninvolved.
- [**2132-1-28**] PET Scan: Interval progression of disease with an
increase in the size of the previously identified
lung metastasis. There is a new FDG-avid focus in segment 4A of
the liver which most likely represents metastasis.
- [**2132-2-13**]: Ileostomy takedown with simultaneous flexible
bronchoscopy and VATS with left lower lobe resection.  Pathology
from the ileostomy stoma demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.

The left lower lobe wedge resection demonstrated an
adenocarcinoma, 4.1 cm, consistent with metastasis of rectal
origin.  The pleural and apparent stapled margins were free of
malignancy.
- [**2132-2-14**]: Evaluation by the hepatobiliary surgery consult
team due to the finding on his recent PET scan of a likely liver
metastasis. It was felt that the lesion was amenable to surgical
resection, and it was planned that the patient would undergo two
cycles of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with hepatic
resection.
- [**2132-4-9**]: FOLFOX chemotherapy initiated. The patient completed
two cycles of therapy on [**2132-6-3**].
- [**2132-7-11**]: Hepatic resection of a 1.7cm segment 4a metastatic
lesion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- [**2132-10-22**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 5FU/LV for further adjuvant
chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin eliminated due to neuropathy. The
patient completed therapy in [**1-5**].
- [**2132-11-26**]: Hospital admission for SVC syndrome secondary to a
catheter-associated thrombus causing occlusion of the SVC and
bilateral brachiocephalic veins. The patient underwent TPA
infusion followed by venous angioplasty with balloon dilation
with resolution of symptoms. He was discharged on enoxaparin.
- [**2133-8-3**]: Initiation of ininotecan for recurrent disease.
- [**2134-2-8**]: Due to laboratory and radiographic evidence of
disease
progression, cetuximab was added to ininotecan; due to an
allergic reaction, cetuximab was changed to panitumumab on
[**2134-2-16**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 72 yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC
syndrome, now resolved on lovenox tx, who was admitted to OMED
on [**4-19**] with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-24**] with BRBPR and hematemesis. GI
was consulted and an EGD was performed on [**4-24**] which showed
diffuse erythema/ulceration, in esophagus, stomach, duodenum.
This was thought due to irinotecan induced GI toxicity.  They
recommended PPI and carafate slurry.  They were concerned that
patient's whole GI tract was diffusely inflamed as was seen on
EGD and that the anastamotic site from his colectomy might be a
bleeding source; a flex sigmoidoscopy was done on as well and
showed as well diffuse ulceration and inflammation. HCTs and q6H
hemodynamics remained stable throughout his hospital course.
The patient was started on steroid enemas and mesalamine
suppositories to decrease inflammation.  The steroid enemas were
discontinued, but the mesalamine suppositories were continued
through to discharge.  In total, he received 3 units PRBCs and 2
units of FFP. Stool cultures revealed no evidence of infection.
.
On [**4-24**], the patient was found to have that 2/2 bottles of his
blood cultures drawn from his portacath were growing GPCs,
speciation showed MSSA. He was treated for this with IV
vancomycin, leaving the portacath and PICC in place. Daily
surveillance blood cultures were performed and he was noted to
clear his bacteremia on [**4-26**].  Infectious diseases was consulted
and the patient was switched to nafcillin with confirmation of
MSSA.  The port-a-cath was removed which was the source of
infection.

The patient however despite aggressive crystalloid and colloid
(albumin, a further 2 units of blood) resuscitation then
developed sepsis related acute tubular necrosis.  The patient
became anuric and nephrology was consulted.  Hemodialysis was
initiated which the patient tolerated well, and a permanent
tunneled catheter line was placed on [**2134-5-7**].  The patient was
started on phosphate binders, nephrocaps and erythropoeitin
dosed at hemodialysis.  The carafate was discontinued due to
risk of aluminum toxicity.  The nafcillin was also changed to
Cefazolin dosed 2mg at each [**Date Range 2286**] session for ease of
administration and avoiding extra volume loading.  Should the
patient miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] session, extra doses of cefazolin should
be administered as needed.  The patient was planned for a 28 day
course of cefazolin to be finished on [**2134-5-22**].
.
Other parts of his hospitalization are outlined by problem
below:
.
#Hypotension/Tachycardia: In setting of extensive diahrrea. Ct
torso is without PE or dissection. His BP initally recovered
with 500cc NS bolus.  Once he had an episode of BRBPR, he became
tacycardic to the 140s, with BP 90s/60s.  He was bolused NS and
given PRBC with improved HR to the 110s, and BP to 120s/80s.
.
#SVC syndrome: occurred in [**2132**]. s/p TPA infusion followed by
venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of
symptoms.  He was initially treated with lovenox (dose
recalculated this admission, should be lower than his admission
dose), but this was held secondary to GI bleed.  This was not
restarted at discharge given the patient's renal failure.
.
#Diarrhea - the patient continued to have diarrhea that was
controlled with titration of his anti-diarrheal medications.
Infectious sources were ruled out and the cause was likely
irinotecan-induced GI toxicity and radiation proctitis.

#Generalized anasarca - The patient was noted to have an
extremely low albumin on admission, likely related to poor
nutrition due to his GI pathology.  Albumins ranged between 2.7
and 1.9.  During volume resuscitation the patient became grossly
edematous, and albumin was administered to little effect.  His
left upper extremity was noted to be more edematous than the
rest of his body, and a LUE ultrasound was acquired.  This
demonstrated no evidence of clot.  The patient slowly became
less edematous when [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] was initiated and ultrafiltration
was started.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Rectal cancer
Diarrhea
Sepsis
Acute Renal Failure


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea. We believe the
diarrhea was a side effect of the chemotherapy you had received;
it was treated with 3 anti-diarrheal medications. You also have
a low blood pressure on admission, this was likely due to
dehydration in the setting of diarrhea, and it improved with
rehydration with IV fluids. Your diarrhea then became bloody,
and you also had an episode of vomit with blood in it. As a
result, you were transferred to the ICU.  You had an upper
endoscopy and a sigmoidoscopy, which showed ulceration in your
esophagus, stomach and colon.  This was thought to be due to the
chemotherapy and radiation that you have been receiving for your
colon cancer.
.
While admitted, you also had a severe bacterial infection that
got into your blood.  This severely damaged your kidneys,
requiring you to be started on hemodialysis.  You had a
permanent [**Location (un) 2286**] catheter placed and you will need to continue
getting [**Location (un) 2286**] 3 times a week.

You were started on several new medications when you were
admitted.

Nephrocaps 1 capsule daily
Phos-lo 667mg three times a day
mesalamine 1000mg suppositories once a day
Cefazolin 2g given with hemodialysis
pantoprazole 40mg daily
Erythropoetin given with hemodialysis

Your metoprolol was changed from 100mg once a day to 25mg three
times a day

Your lisinopril and enoxaparin have been discontinued.


Followup Instructions:
You need to follow up with your outpatient oncologists, Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] discuss any further treatment for you
rectal cancer.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Colorectal Cancer Clinic on
