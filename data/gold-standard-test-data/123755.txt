1. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size
with a hypertrophied septum. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta graft material is seen. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There is spontaneous echo contrast and thrombus along the
wall (diameter measures 4.5x5cm).
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to
moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2116-11-9**]
at 930.
9. Surgeons used fluroscopy to check for endoleaks rather than
request TEE.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-11-9**] and underwent endovascular
repair of her thoracic aortic aneurysm. Pt tolerated the
procedure well. For full detail please see operative reports. Pt
went to the ICU post-operatively and remained intubated due to
low tidal volumes. Pt remained on a fentanyl drip for pain
control and was placed on an insulin sliding scale for tight
glycemic control post-operatively. Pt was extubated the morning
of POD1 on [**11-10**]. Pt was weaned on nitroglycerin drip. On [**11-11**]
diet was begun and advanced to clears the lumbar drain was
removed. The pt was transferred from the ICU to the VICU
stepdown unit, the PA catheter and arterial line were removed.
BP was controlled with lopressor. Pt began to work with physical
therapy on [**11-12**]. BP management was transitioned to her home
medications of amlodipine, Atenolol, and enalapril. Home
medications were restarted. Noted on telemetry, pt had several
asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia. The cardiology service was
consulted who recommended changing her blood pressure management
to Losartan and discontinuing her previous home medications.
There were no further bradycardic events after this change was
made and her pressures were well controlled. On [**11-13**] physical
therapy continued as pt was still quite unsteady. Pt was
discharged home on [**11-14**] with home physical therapy, tolertating
a regular diet.
