History of Present Illness:
69 F c hx of CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic CM EF 25%,
asthma, multiple recent admissions (most recently [**Date range (1) 27916**] to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fall and hypoglycemia thought [**2-21**] insulin use in the

STUDIES:
==========
CXR [**6-6**]
MPRESSION: Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may indicate
small pleural effusion or basilar atelectasis. A faint right
lower lobe opacity may be due to bronchovascular crowding,
however an early developing pneumonia can not be excluded.

RUQ U/S [**6-6**]
IMPRESSION: Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Study is
otherwise unremarkable.

CTA CHEST [**6-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Very small subsegmental left apical pulmonary emboli,
unlikely to account for the patient's severe hypotensive
episode.
2. Bibasilar pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
associated airspace disease, atelectasis versus aspiration or
pneumonia.
3. Cardiomegaly and dense coronary artery calcifications.

LENI [**6-7**]
IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to patient agitation and motion. No
definite evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Please note that left lower extremity venous ultrasound was not
performed due to patient incooperation.

CT HEAD [**6-8**]
IMPRESSION:
No change in subacute to chronic infarctions at the right
occipital and parietal lobes. No new evidence of acute ischemia
or acute hemorrhage is seen.

ECHO [**6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis
and inferior and apical akinesis (LVEF= 20 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-7**],
the degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are probabaly
similar (underestimated on prior report). The LVEF is similar.
The degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.

EEG [**6-9**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and
sleeping
states due to the disorganized, low voltage, and slow background
with
admixed bursts of moderate amplitude generalized mixed frequency

slowing. This constellation of findings is consistent with a
mild
global encephalopathy due to dysfunction of bilateral
subcortical or
deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
infection
and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy but
there are
others. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There
were no
epileptiform features.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y.o. F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic CM EF 25%,
asthma, multiple recent admissions (most recently [**Date range (1) 27916**] to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fall and hypoglycemia thought [**2-21**] insulin use in the
setting of ARF; previously [**Date range (1) 107613**] c respiratory failure
thought [**2-21**] COPD and CHF. found by her VNA to hypoxic to 80's on
RA.  Upon arrival to the ED VS= 86% on ra, HR 100, BP 155/59, RR
32.

She was treated for COPD flare (steroids), CHF (bipap, lasix,
nitro gtt), and PNA (levaquin).  CTA not performed [**2-21**] inability
to lie flat, but pt empirically started on heparin gtt.  Her
oxygen status improved and she was transferred to the MICU.

In the MICU, pt's antibiotic coverage was broadened to CTX/vanco
and azithromycin.  In the setting of her first azithromycin dose
on [**6-6**], pt became hypotensive requiring pressors (levo, neo,
vaso), felt to be an allergic reaction to the azithromycin.
Pressors were titrated off ~12 hrs later on [**6-7**].  Her
respiratory status continued to improve, and she was weaned of
bipap on [**6-7**], and steroids were discontinued as COPD was felt
less likely.

On [**6-7**] pt's HCT 31->24, she was transfused 1U PRBC, complicated
by grand mal seizure, and hypotension, again requiring pressors
(levo, neo, vaso) for ~12hrs.  Neuro was consulted as there was
also a question of left dilated pupil, head CT showed no acute
bleeding, +subacute/chronic infarctions, EEG c/w toxic/metabolic
insult, heparin gtt was held.  CTA was obtained which showed
very small left apical PE, felt unlikely to account for
hypotension.  TTE revealed EF=20% (old), 2+mr, 3+tr.

On [**6-9**], repeat blood transfusion performed without
complication.  HCT 21->26, however hemolysis labs revealed
hapto<20, LDH 760->468, smear +schistocytes, suggestive of
hemolysis, DAT negative x 2 ([**6-8**], [**6-9**]).  Per report, pt's
mental status (which waxes and wanes), is not far from her
baseline.  She responds to voice, but is a&ox1 (name) only.

On [**6-10**] O2 and BP were stable and pt was transferred to the
floor.  On the Floor she completed her course of Vanc/Cefepime.
Her BP stabilized and she was restarted on home antihypertensive
regimen.  Fingersticks remained elevated, and her glargine was
increased for better glycemic control.  She continued on
albuterol and atrovent prn for shortness of breath/wheezing.
Heme/onc was consulted regarding hemolysis and anticoagulation.
Their recommendations stated that the exact cause of hemolysis
is difficult to interpret, however by the time the pt was on the
floor, the hct was rising and LDH was falling suggesting that
hemolysis was resolving.  They recommended that there was no
contraindication to anticoagulation.  Given her multiple
indications for anticoagulation, decision was made to begin
coumadin with a lovenox bridge. Her INR was 1.9 on discharge,
and she will continue on lovenox SQ until INR therapeutic at 2-3
and coumadin 10 mg daily.  The lovenox may be stopped after
therapeutic INR.  INRs should be followed and her dose adjusted
accordingly.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Pneumonia
Sepsis
Pulmonary Embolism
Atrial Fibrillation
Congestive Heart Failure


Discharge Condition:
Oxygenation stable, BP stable.  A+Ox1 (at baseline).


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with low oxygen level.  You were treated for
pneumonia, COPD, and blood clot in the lung.  Your blood
pressure fell after recieving azithromycin, and this was thought
to be due to an allergic reaction.  Your blood pressure also
fell after receiving a blood transfusion and you had a seizure.
Neurology evaluated you and felt that you did not need and
seizure medications.  With antibiotics, your oxygenation
improved, and your blood pressure stabilized.  You were started
on lovenox and then coumadin to treat the clots in your lung.
.
Because of your diagnosis of congestive heart failure, you
should weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: 1500 cc/day.
.
Take all of your medications as prescribed below.  Changes
include:
1. Senna 1 tablet twice daily as needed for constipation
2. Colace 1 tablet twice daily as needed for constipation
3. Warfarin 10 mg daily
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg tablet daily
5. Digoxin [**1-21**] tablet (0.0625 mg) daily
6. Lovenox 90mg SQ every 12 hours (until therapeutic INR)
.
Keep all of your appointments as written below.
.
If you have symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, chest pain,
fevers, or anyother concerning symptoms call your doctor or go
to the ER.

Followup Instructions:
