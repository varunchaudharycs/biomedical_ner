Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88321**] is a 48 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HCV cirrhosis and a recent admission for a traumatic fall
with multiple IPH requiring bolt placement, multiple orthopedic
fractures s/p surgeries, trach/PEG with hospital course
complicated by Serratia pneumonia treated with pip/tazo now
admitted for hypoxemia. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 88322**] after a 30 foot fall from height with multiple IPH
s/p intracranial bolt placement for elevated ICP, multiple
orthopedic fractures requiring surgical intervention,
splenectomy, and trach/PEG. He was noted to develop a VAP that
speciated as pan-sensitive Serratia and he completed a course of
pip/tazo, and also had a right-sided pneumothorax requiring
chest tube placement. Per report, the patient was noted at rehab
to have been progressively hypoxemic over the past 2 days with a
outpatient CXR concerning for right-sided pneumonia. He did not
have increased sputum production or fevers. He was then sent to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.1 62 92/54 18 95% 40% FM. CXR
notable for right-sided complete opacification, for which the
patient received vanco and pip/tazo. He was placed on volume
cycled assist control, and was sent for a CT chest to rule out
diaphragmatic rupture. While at CT, he received 5 haldol iv and
2 iv ativan for agitation, after which he was arousable to
stimulation. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation, minimally
responsive to verbal stimuli.

ROS: Limited given somnolence.

Past Medical History:
Admitted [**Date range (1) 88323**] for 30 foot fall from roof. Multiple
IPH(multiple intraparenchymal petechial, hemorrhages at
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, as well as involving the right mid
brain, consistent with diffuse axonal injury), facial fractures,
bilateral arm fractures as well as right knee fracture.
Underwent splenectomy, multiple orthopedic surgeries.

Imaging Studies:

Chest CT without contrast ([**2156-12-20**]):
1. No evidence of diaphragmatic hernia.
2. Large right and moderate left simple pleural effusions.
Consolidation and volume loss in the lower lobes bilaterally,
right greater than left, may represent atelectasis however,
aspiration or superimposed infection cannot entirely be
excluded.
3. Healing rib and clavicle fractures, as described above.
4. No pneumothorax.

Chest x-ray ([**2156-12-21**]): In comparison with the earlier study of
this date, there has been removal of a substantial amount of
right pleural effusion with a small residual. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube remains in place and there is
again evidence of volume loss at the left base.

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2156-12-21**]: The left atrium and
right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
appears bicuspid with mildly thickened leaflets, eccentric
closure point and fused right and left raphe. A gradient could
not be assessed, but there does not appear to be significant
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Probable bicuspid aortic valve with fused right/left
raphe and no significant stenosis or regurgitation. Dilated
ascending aorta. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with preserved global biventricular systolic function. If there
is a clinical suspicion for an aortic dissection - a thoracic
CT/MRI or TEE are suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88321**] is a 48 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for HCV cirrhosis and a recent admission for a traumatic fall
with multiple IPH requiring bolt placement, multiple orthopedic
fractures s/p surgeries, trach/PEG with hospital course
complicated by Serratia pneumonia treated with pip/tazo now
admitted for hypoxemia.

# Hypoxemia/leukocytosis: CTAP demonstrates a new right-sided
pleural effusion with RLL collapse and volume loss throughout
right side. Compressive atelectasis was considered, although
could not rule out HCAP. With regard to new pleural effusion,
LFTs were largely unchanged from prior, making hepatic
hydrothorax unlikely. This may be a parapneumonic effusion with
underlying pneumonia, or could also be from new heart failure.
Would also consider chylothorax given history of trauma. The
patient underwent thoracentesis on the first hospital day and
1.2 liters of exudative fluid were removed from the right
pleural space. Cultures from the fluid came back negative, and
the antibiotics were stopped. Trauma surgery was consulted who
felt that the pleural fluid might be secondary to trauma. They
recommended for repeat imaging in [**2-4**] days to see if the fluid
was reaccumulating. Also, they recommended for repeat imaging if
the patient develops any new respiratory symptoms.
Interestingly, the fluid from the thoracentesis had an
eosinophilic predominance (56% eosinophils). At the same time,
the patient was noted to have a peripheral blood eosinophilia.
This was all felt to be secondary to Depakote, which had been
recently started. The divalproex was therefore stopped.

Notably, after the thoracentesis, the patient's respiratory
status improved markedly and he was able to be weaned back to
the trach mask. With regard to work-up for other causes of
pleural effusion, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show
any cardiac dysfunction, and infectious studies, as above, all
returned negative. Cytologic analysis showed no malignant cells.
Antibiotics were stopped after the first hospital day.

Due to the calficifications noted on CT scan, a tuberculin skin
test was placed to the right forearm on [**12-22**]. This should be
interpreted on [**12-24**] or [**12-25**]. The spot of the PPD placement is
marked with a bandaid.

# Mental status: His mental status remained at baseline, per
family members and rehab facility notes. He was agitated and
minimally interactive. He required prn doses of Haldol and
Ativan for agitation. With regard to the history of traumatic
brain injury, neurosurgery was consulted during this admission
and did not feel there was any need for intervention. Head CT
was deferred. He was continued on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis. Divalproex, as above, was stopped due to peripheral
blood and pleural fluid eosinophilia.

# Anemia: Hematocrit was 35.8 on admission, baseline during last
admission 27-33 with macrocytosis. His hematocrit remained
stable.

# Orthopedics: Orthopedics was contact[**Name (NI) **] during this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to worsening shortness of
breath.  You came to the hospital and had a chest xray which
showed an accumulation of fluid around the right lung.  The
fluid around your lung was drained, and your shortness of breath
improved.  We felt the fluid accumulation was due to the new
medication you started called "Depakaote".  As a result, we
discontinued this medication.
You should follow up with your psychiatrist to make sure your
medications are appropriately controlling your agitation.

CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS:
DEPAKOTE---> STOP TAKING THIS MEDICATION


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up at the [**Hospital1 18**] orthopedic hand clinic within 2
weeks by Tuesday [**2157-1-4**].  Please call to confimr
