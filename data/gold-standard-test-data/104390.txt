Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with no significant PMHx recently s/p excisional
biopsy of salivary gland tumor on [**2154-5-16**] (did not have a
parotid dissection). Two days later she presented to the ED with
dysphagia and found to have cellulitis of surgical wound. She
was hospitalized for 5 days, treated with antibiotics and
discharged on Keflex. She had been doing well until Tuesday/Wed
when she began experiencing fevers with associated generalized
malaise, fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted, did
improve with Tylenol or Advil, until she saw her OTL surgeon
this morning for follow up. She was found to be febrile to 103
and with hypotension to mid-80s systolic. She was sent to the ED
with evaluation.

On review of systems the patient is completely asymptomatic
aside from weakness and malaise. No sore throat, no runny nose,
eye pain or discharge, sinus pain, no neck pain or stiffness, no
redness, swelling or pain at site of incision. No cough, SOB,
chest pain, no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Patient does endorse increased urinary frequency but no dysuria.
No rashes or joint pain, no leg swelling.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99 101 93/49 16 96%.  CBC showed
white blood cell count of 5.1K.  Sodium was 128 on Chem7.
Lactate was 1.0.  Urinalysis was negative and blood cultures
were sent.  Patient was administered 1 liter NS.  Chest X-ray
showed no focal consolidation or effusion, no acute process.
ENT was consulted and initially did not think there was anything
going on with the surgical site.  CT neck was performed which
showed fat stranding at site of right posterior submandibular
node resection, with no drainable fluid collection.  Overall
there was an improved post-op appearance compared to recent
imaging in [**4-/2154**], with less mass effect upon the parapharyngeal
space and stable edema of the right sternocleidomastoid.  CTA
chest was also performed with no pulmonary emboli noted, but
scattered mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm.
Initially, cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were
administered PO.  Patient was admitted to observation with plan
for likely discharge in the morning.  Around 0230, patient
dropped systolic blood pressures to 70s, was tachycardic to the
130s, with a temperature of 104.8F, RR 40s, with O2 sat 77% on
RA, but improved to mid-90s with nasal cannula O2
administration.  She was reported to have skin mottling of the
extremities.  A left external jugular peripheral line was
inserted and administration of 2 liters NS IVF was bolused.
Patient was administed vancomycin, ceftriaxone and metronidazole
IV.  ENT was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended MICU admission, and
thought there was no surgical intervention needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo female with no significant PMHx recently s/p excisional
biopsy of salivary gland tumor on [**2154-5-16**] with a postop
course complicated by cellulitis, now presenting with fevers and
hypotension. Treatment with fluids and Abx in ICU resolved
hypotension and fever, but she developed a rash which is most
likely drug-induced. Abx discontinued and she was transfered to
the floor where she has remained stable. Discharged on hospital
stay day 4.

Active issues:
# Cellulitis: Pt admitted with hypotension occurring during
treatment for cellulitis on Keflex.  Pt received approximately
13days of Keflex prior to admission to ICU. While in the ICU pt
received Vanc/CTX/Flagyl IV and ICU stay was complicated by drug
eruption (see below).  IV abx were discontinued and pt remained
afebrile and stable for >36 hrs prior to discharge.  Pt was
transferred to the floor where she continued to do well with no
evidence of recurrence of cellulitis. We discussed with ENT and
they agreed that she does not need to be sent home on
antibiotics.

# Drug Eruption: Pt. was febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive
with pruritic pink papules over her back and arms that developed
after taking a cephalosporin for post-op cellulitis.  There was
no infectious etiology determined as CXR, UA, Ucx were negative
and CT of neck did not reveal a fluid collection around surgical
site.  Pt was fluid resuscitated and received benadryl and
famotidine for drug rxn and topical steroid for pruritis.
Eruption slowly faded and became non-pruritic.

#Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia that
resolved with fluid resuscitation.

# Anemia: unknown etiology with HH 11.4&35.  H&H remained stable
over admission and eventually recovered to 12.4 on day of
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

Thank you for choosing us for your care. You were admitted with
cellulitis (a skin infection) and hypotension (low blood
pressure).  In the ICU you received IV fluids and antibiotics.
You developed a rash that was likely a response to the
antibiotics you recieved. In this context, we stopped the
antibiotics. You have been off antibiotics for 3 days and your
skin infection has resolved.

We are not sure which of the antibiotics contributed to your
rash, but in the future, please just be on alert when using any
of the following: Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, Keflex,
Bactrim.

There are no changes to your medications. Please continue to
take the medicines you had been on at home.
