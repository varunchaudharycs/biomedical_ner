Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and lip swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 38758**] is a 34F with mixed connective tissue disease /
rheumatoid arthritis on immunosuppression with leflunamide and
prednisone who returns with fevers x1 day.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11069**] treated with
vancomycin and fluconazole for MSSA and C. parapsilosis
osteomyelitis of the fingers and hand, as well as a suspected
coagulase-negative staph line infection. Her hospital course was
notable for moderate hypertension to 130-150's systolic and she
was discharged on lisinopril.
.
She reports feeling in her usual state of health following
discharge. The day prior to presentation she developed some
subjective chills and low grade temp to 99F. Overnight, she felt
like she "bit her lip." When she woke up the morning of
presentation, her husband noticed that her lip was swollen.
Repeat temperature was 101F leading her to present for further
evaluation in the ER.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T102.3 P 120 BP 146/100 100% on RA.
Found to have swelling of upper lip, reported tongue tingling.
Also had tenderness over her port. Handling secretions and in no
respiratory distress. She was given methylprednisolone 125mg,
acetaminophen, benadryl for suspected angioedema. Took Pepcid at
home. Vitals T 99 102 137/95 20 100% on RA. Has PIV x1 and port.

.
On evaluation in the ICU, she has no major complaints. Denies
dyspnea, dysphagia or odynophagia, rash, tearing. She denies
ever having similar swelling before. Last dose of lisinopril was
the evening prior to presentation. Only other new medication was
MS contin, which she also started the day prior to presentation.
She notes mild tenderness around her port over the last week,
without any erythema or discharge. Apparently her VNA had
trouble drawing back from the port last week, but this problem
did not persist. She feels that her fingers are healing well -
pain is at baseline, no drainage or swelling.
.
On review of systems she reports mild headache the evening prior
to admission and some neck and back discomfort today which is
now resolved after steroids. She has occasional sensation of ear
"popping" but denies sinus or throat discomfort. Has a chronic
"smokers cough" productive of small amounts of phlegm. She
denies nausea or vomiting, but has had mild abdominal discomfort
that she notices only when pressing on her abdomen. She has been
constipated with last bowel movement the day prior to
presentation, no diarrhea. Also denies any dysuria or urinary
frequency. Her joint pains are at baseline. No recent travel, no
tick bites or other animal contacts.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 38758**] is a 34F with mixed connective tissue disease on
medical immunosuppression with prednisone and leflunamide and
recurrent digit osteomyelitis who returns with fevers and lip
swelling.
.
#Angioedema: The patient was evaluated by Allergy who felt the
most likely etiology was the newly started ACEI (started 5d
prior to noted symptoms). There was never any evidence of
respiratory compromise, hypotension or other signs concerning
for anaphylaxis. Allergy serologies (tryptase, C1 inhibitor and
C2) are pending at time of discharge. Steroids were transitioned
to  oral. On discharge patient was scheduled to complete steroid
taper over 3 days (20mg x1d, 10mg x1d, 7.5mg ongoing as home
dose). She received pepcid and benadryl x48h and then
fexofenadine x48h. The presenting lip swelling, tingling
resolved within 24h and remained absent during her admission.
She is scheduled for follow-up with Allergy within 1 week of
discharge. She was instructed to avoid ACEI in the future. The
potential use of [**Last Name (un) **] in this setting remains controversial and
formal recommendations regarding future use of [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred
to the Allergy service.
.
#Fever: Initial fever and bandemia were concerning for
infection. Patient remained afebrile after initial T103F on
admission. Of note, there was consideration for prednisone
related fever suppression and the patient was advised to
continue to monitor for fever during prednisone taper following
discharge.
.
Per discussion with Allergy, ACE related angioedema was likely
not an etiology in fever. Most likely sources were felt to be
(1) persistent osteomyelitis of the R digits versus (2) CVC
endovascular infection. After coordinated discussion with the
patient's in-patient and out-patient attendings (ID,
Rheumatology, Surgery, Medicine) the decision was made to remove
the port. Rationale included (a) prior positive CVC culture with
CoNS in the setting of CoNS growing from R hand OR cultures, (b)
persistent port site tenderness, (c) limited anticipated use of
Port for next several months [immunosuppressive regimen is being
deferred until completion of Fluconazole course which is
anticipated to end in [**2145-11-30**]], (d) potential future risk
for fungal colonization given known Candidal osteomyelitis.
There was low concern for other mechanisms of infection
including resistant organisms ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] noted as Fluc sensitive,
MSSA, CoNS both Vancomycin sensitive), non gram positive
organisms (Bld Cx remained negative during this admission;
Bld/Port Cx x2), metastatic infection (recent TTE negative for
vegetation, no focal si/sx suggestive of other metastatic sites
including spleen/abdomen and spine).
.
She will be scheduled for Port removal with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PA is
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who will assist in coordination of PICC
placement. She was evaluated by the IV team prior to discharge
who felt out-patient PICC placement with consideration for IR
guidance was an appropriate plan. Of note, the removed
Port-A-Cath tip should be sent for culture (bacterial, fungal,
AFB).
.
#HTN: Patient's blood pressures remained 130-150s/80s-110s.
Metoprolol was increased from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] with
improvement in blood pressures. Additional regimen changes were
deferred to the outpatient setting following steroid taper,
given potential steroid related contribution to noted
hypertension. Patient experienced Metoprolol related GI
upset/dysphagia which resolved with administration w/ food.
Patient additionally expressed concern re: potential side
effects re: Raynaud's and beta blockade. Of note, prior
literature supports safety of use of metoprolol specifically in
the setting of Raynaud's.
.
# Mixed connective tissue disease: Her home immunosuppressants
were continued and she is to follow-up with rheumatology as
outpatient. She was instructed to hold Mobic (an NSAID) pending
surgical Port-A-Cath removal.
.
#Post-operative Pain: Patients pain regimen was continued. MS
Contin was increased from 15mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit was stably 30-32 during admission. Iron
studies were suggestive of mixed Fe-deficiency anemia and anemia
of chronic disease (Fe 31, TIBC 328, Ferritin 66). She was
written for FeSulfate on discharge with follow-up Fe studies
deferred to the patient's primary care physician.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of fever
and lip swelling. It was felt that the lip swelling was most
likely an allergic reaction to Lisinopril (and to the broader
classes of medications known as ACE Inhibitors). You should
avoid taking ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in
the future.
.
Your fever was felt to be most likely related to either
osteomyelitis but we could not rule out the possibility of a
Port-A-Cath infection. The plan after discussing with several
providers involved in your care will be for Port-A-Cath removal
next week, interval Linezolid x48h, followed by PICC (IV)
placement for the completion of Vancomycin for your known
osteomyelitis.
.
Your blood pressures were elevated during your hospitalization.
The dose of Metoprolol was increased from 25mg twice a day to
50mg twice a day. You will need to follow-up with your primary
care physician for potential further management of your blood
pressure. You may also benefit from purchasing a home blood
pressure machine to measure your BPs intermittently.
.
Please do not take your Mobic for 7 days prior to anticipated
Port removal.
.
If you experience new fever (particularly in the setting of
prednisone taper), worsening headache, chest pain, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, back
pain, visual changes (decreased acuity, blurriness), or any
symptom that concerns you please contact your primary care
physician or return to the hospital.
