69 yo M with CAD s/p CABG complicated be restenosis requiring
multiple stents, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin, recurrent
GI bleeding and IDDM who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for advanced endoscopy for management of active upper
GI bleed.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] approximately one
week ago with melena and hematocrit of 22, found to have a
NSTEMI (medical management per cardiology, restarted on plavix -
d/c'ed in [**2154**] given recurrent gi bleeds, 1 month after BMS
placed).  Upper endoscopy was unrevealing except for mild
gastritis.  Colonoscopy last done one year ago which was
unremarkable except for benign polyps.  Patient was transfused 4
units of pRBCs, hematorcrit increased to 27 and discharged three
days ago.  Of note, he required diuresis for decompensated CHF.
Was seen in the ED on [**4-21**] for chest pain, no EKG changes,
resolved with nitro, discharged home.
.
Patient was re-admitted to [**Hospital3 **] today ([**2156-4-26**]) with
recurrent melena.  Last night he had two black/tarry stools.  He
also endorsed some mild chest pain.  His hematocrit on admission
was 26.2.  Patient transfused 1 unit of packed cells.  He ruled
out for ACS by three sets of negative cardiac enzymes and
non-ischemic EKG.  Patient underwent a CT angiogram which
revealed 3 small bowel foci of hemorrhage likely in the proximal
ileum.  Given the location of the bleeding decision made by
gastroenterologist to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for single balloon
enteroscopy.  Patient has been continued on plavix given his
significant cardiac comorbidities.  He has been bridged with a
heparin gtt for a subtherapeutic INR of 1.9.
.
Of note, patient had recurrent GI bleeding at site of
anastamosis from sigmoid colectomy in [**2154**], requiring multiple
transfusions.  Was on asa/plavix/coumadin with recent BMS placed
in diagonal.  ASA stopped and plavix discontinued 1 month after
BMS placement given recurrent bleeding.  He had no further
bleeding issues until this past week.
.
Currently patient has no complaints.  Denies any current chest
pain, sob, lightheadedness or dizziness.  No nausea, vomiting or
abdominal pain.  Reports one episode of black stool prior to
transfer.
.
ROS as per HPI, 10 pt ROS otherwise negative.

[**4-28**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
[Normal for this prosthesis.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
The gradient across the mitral valve is slightly increased (mean
= 3-4 mmHg) resulting in trivial/minimal mitral stenosis. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mechanical
aortic valve but with increased gradient. Well seated mitral
annuloplasty ring with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated
thoracic aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2144-12-25**], the aortic valve gradient is increased
and minimal mitral stenosis is now identified.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may be better able to define the
cause of the increased gradient across the aortic valve.

[**2156-4-30**] small bowel enteroscopy report: (from above)
Healthy surgical anastomosis at left colon corresponding to the
previous colectomy.  Moderate to severe diverticulosis in the
entire colon.
The terminal ileum was entered and the scope was advanced to the
proximal/mid ileum. A few tiny red spots were seen. But there
was no active bleeding. No AVM or mass lesions were seen.
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the
duodenum.
.
[**2156-4-29**] small bowel enteroscopy report: (from below)
The examined proximal ileum was normal. No active bleeding or
AVM or mass was seen.  Impression: Normal esophagus; A tiny
nonbleeding erosion seen at the antrum; Mild and pathy erythema
seen at duodenal bulb; Normal jejunum. No active bleeding or AVM
or mass seen. Itattooed for marking;
Normal proximal ileum. No active bleeding or AVM or mass seen.
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to distal
jejunum/proximal ileum.



Brief Hospital Course:
REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION:
Pt is a 69 y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG complicated by
restenosis requiring multiple stents and recent NSTEMI,
mechanical aortic valve on coumadin, recurrent GI bleeds and
IDDM who was transferred from OSH with melena and CTA showing
active bleeding in proximal ileum.
.
#upper GI bleed/acute blood loss/anemia-CTA per OSH report
showed active bleeding in the proximal ileum. Pt with recent EGD
with non-bleeding gastritis. Last colonoscopy 1 yr ago with
polyps. UGIB in the setting of restarting plavix 1 week ago for
NSTEMI. PT also on couamdin for mechanical valve, and started on
heparin ggt as coumadin was held in setting of procedure. Hct
remained stable. Pt was placed on a protonix gtt. Plavix was
continued up until transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], then restarted. Discussed
anticoagulation with patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32772**] who felt
as though pt should be on heparin gtt as long as deemed safe
from GI procedure prospective. Would prefer to restart ASAP
after any procedure. In addition, outpt cardiologist felt as
though pt should be on plavix unless there is presence of
hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. He agreed that pt does
not tolerate dual anti-platelet therapy (per pt, ASA caused
bleeding). Enteroscopy was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2156-4-29**] which
showed no evidence of bleeding via approach from above. Small
bowel enteroscopy/colonoscopy was performed [**2156-4-30**] which was
similarly unremarkable. Pt was restarted on warfarin and heparin
gtt. Pt went home [**2156-5-1**] on lovenox as bridge, with INR checks
planned for [**2156-5-3**] and [**2156-5-5**].
.
#CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: s/p CABG and PCI x2, severe CAD with
chronic angina medically managed. Recent NSTEMI with decision to
restart plavix after being held x2 years due to recurrent GI
bleeds. At [**Hospital1 18**] plavix was held initially as GI team was
uncomfortable doing procedure on plavix as interventions for
bleeding (ex. clipping, cauterization could lead to more
bleeding while on plavix). In addition, it was felt that at the
time plavix effects would still be in his system as there was no
complete washout period. As above, discussed case with pt's
outpatient cardiologist who felt that pt would need to remain on
plavix unless life hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. Pt
was continued on imdur, statin, beta blocker held, see
bradycardia below. He was ruled out for MI at OSH prior to
transfer. He was monitored on tele. Without events.
.
# MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE: placed at St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]. Patient's goal
INR 3.5 for  mechanical valve. Was switched to heparin which was
stopped 6 hours prior to procedures. Given significant risk of
thrombosis, heparin was restarted after procedures, despite
patient's known GI bleed. HCT was monitored closely and remained
stable. Heparin gtt was changed to lovenox on discharge, see
above.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient noted to be bradycardic after procedure.
Thought to be related to sedation for procedure. Improved as the
patient woke up from sedation. Still, HR remained in the 50-60
range throughout hospitalization. Initially home beta blocker
was held. Pt was monitored on telemetry without events. He was
asymptomatic. Home atenolol restarted on discharge.
.
#DIABETES MELLITUS - type 2, with complications, peripheral
neuropathy.  Placed on conservative insulin regimen while NPO.
Pt resumed meformin and glyburide upon discharge. Continued
gabapentin for neuropathy.
.
#HYPERTENSION - benign; initially held beta blocker in setting
of bradycardia. Continued imdur. Held lisinopril while NPO. On
the morning of discharge his blood pressure was elevated in the
170s systolic. We then restarted his home medications (atenolol,
lisinopril) which we had been holding and felt these would be
adequate for blood pressure control.
.
#DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE - chronic, but with recent acute
exacerbation. Lasix was held while pt was NPO, and also was
given with 1u pRBCs.
.
#hypothyroidism-continued synthroid
.
#HL-continued simvastatin
.
#GERD-on PPI ggt for c/f GI bleed as above, transitioned to PO
PPI on discharge
.
#leukopenia/thrombocytopenia-unclear etiology. Could be due to
acute process. Thrombocytopenia could be consumptive. PLT count
was monitored closely and remained stable.
.
Pt was maintained as FULL CODE throughout the course of this
hospitalization.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
anticoagulation: pt sent home on warfarin (subtherapeutic after
holding for procedures) and lovenox. He will need INR checked
Monday [**2156-5-3**] and Wednesday [**2156-5-5**] likely to DC lovenox [**2156-5-5**]
as ideally he would have a 48 hour therapeutic overlap. Pt was
instructed to follow up with PCP regarding this issue.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Acute blood loss anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding
CAD s/p stenting and mechanical aortic valve
Recent NSTEMI
HTN


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32776**],

You were admitted for further evaluation of gastrointestinal
bleeding. For this, you had endoscopic procedures both from
above and below the level of the stomach, both which were
unrevealing for a source of bleeding.  This likely occurred in
the presence of multiple blood thinners, causing leaking of a
vessel which stopped once we held your blood thinners.
 We discussed the risks and benefits of being on blood thinners.
 Given your cardiac history, including stents and mechanical
heart valves, it is necessary that your remain on warfarin and
an antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (such as aspirin or clopidogrel AKA
Plavix), to prevent a stroke and a heart attack respectively.
You will be discharged on warfarin at your usual home dose as
well as clopidogrel (Plavix).  Please note to follow up with
your cardiologest within the week to assure you are on the most
appropriate therapy for your cardiac health.
  As you know, your INR was below goal prior to discharge (goal
2.5-3.5), since we held your warfarin in the hospital so you
could have procedures.  You will be going home on enoxaparin
(AKA Lovenox)injections to keep your blood thin while your INR
becomes therepeutic.

Medication changes:
Please START taking Clopidogrel (AKA Plavix) 75mg po qday
Please START taking Enoxaparin subcutaneous injections until
your INR is therepeutic
Please continue taking the rest of your medications as
prescribed.
.
It has been a pleasure taking care of you Mr. [**Known lastname 32776**]!

Followup Instructions:
Please arrange follow up with your primary care doctor and your
cardiologist within 1 week of discharge.  You will need to have
your INR on Monday [**2156-5-3**] and Wednesday [**2156-5-5**]. Speak to your
primary care physician but you should stop lovenox on Wednesday
[**2156-5-5**] if Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26652**] approves.
