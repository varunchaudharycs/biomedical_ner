PATHOLOGY:
[**2178-12-17**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: ILEUM.

DIAGNOSIS:

Ileum, Segmental resection:
1.  Ischemic enteritis with focally transmural necrosis and
associated serositis.
2.  One unremarkable resection margin; opposite resection margin
with mucosal ischemic changes and acute inflammation of the
superficial submucosa.

Clinical:  Ischemic bowel, acute abdomen.
Gross:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,
"[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]", the medical record number and "ileum." It
consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 92 cm in length
and 3 cm in average diameter.  A portion of mesentery is
attached to the small bowel that measures 2 x 4 x 3 cm. The
specimen is not oriented.  The mesentery is unremarkable. The
serosa of the bowel is focally erythematous and dusky looking.
There are two staples measuring 3.7 and 5.2 cm.  The specimen is
opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal fecal material
and blood within the lumen. The mucosa in the central portion of
the bowel measuring 34 cm in length is erythematous, brown and
dusky looking. No masses or polyps are identified.  No
perforation site is identified.  The bowel wall within the
affected area measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.  Normal
looking bowel measures up to 0.4 cm in thickness.  The specimen
is represented in cassettes as follows:  A = 5.2 cm stapled
margin, B = 3.7 cm staple margin, C = section of affected bowel,
D = transition between effected and normal bowel, E-G = fat.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with multiple medical problems was admitted to the
General Surgical Service on [**2178-12-17**] for evaluation of an acute
abdomen likely from ischemic bowel.  He was admitted to the
SICU. He was made NPO, started on IV fluids, a foley catheter
and CVL were placed, empiric IV Vancomycin and Zosyn were
started, and he was given Fentanyl IV PRN for pain and Valium
for sedation. He was emergently brought to the Operating Room,
where he underwent exploratory laparotomy, reduction of internal
volvulus of the small bowel, and small-bowel resection with
primary anastomosis(reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). He was found to have ischemic bowel with obstruction,
peritonitis, and an internal volvulus of the small bowel.
He was returned to the SICU for post-operative care.

.
Please resume all regular home medications , unless specifically

medications.

Please follow-up with your surgeon and Primary Care Provider
(PCP) as advised.

increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision
site.
*Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap
and warm water.  Gently pat the area dry.
*If you have steri-strips, they will fall off on their own.
Please remove any remaining strips 7-10 days after surgery.
*The lower incision wound will be cared for by your nurse. Car
is a wet-to-dry dressing changed twice daily.
.
Coumadin (Warfarin):

What is this medicine used for?
This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not
form.

How does it work?
Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood
to prevent clots from forming.

What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:
Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing;
chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color;
fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe
dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you
hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel
fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically,
severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black,
tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds,
coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,
severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.

Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for
whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems,
vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems
could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.

Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:
Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.
For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat
while taking this medication.

Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid
foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of
vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However,
recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K
from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your
dietary vitamin K intake.

These foods contain vitamin K:
Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli,
Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,
Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens,
Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver.
Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,
Soybeans and Cashews.

Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage
but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious
problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you
drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual
pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on
special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually
would on any regular day of the week.

Monitoring:
The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by
testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is
clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for
bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for
forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood
test that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring
is called an INR.

Use of Other medications:
When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can
change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also
change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to
talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you
are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics,
vitamins, or herbal products.
