Imaging:
----------
CT Chest [**2156-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal bilateral air space opacities most consistent with
acute
infection.
2. New moderate left pleural effusion.
3. Increase in size of several mediastinal lymph nodes may
rleate to
infection, though attention is recommended on follow-up.
Attention should also be again paid to the unchnanged right
lower lobe nodule.
4. Progression of thoracic spine osseous metastases.

CT Head [**2156-1-15**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, midline
shift or other
acute abnormalities. No evidence of enhancing brain lesions. No
significant
change on the pre-contrast images compared to [**2154-8-5**].

CXR [**2156-1-16**]:
Since yesterday, all tubes and catheters are in unchanged
position.
Right upper lobe opacity persists, likely due to aspiration.
Left lower lobe opacity increased, could be due to worsening
atelectasis or superimposed aspiration. Left pleural effusion
also increased. There is no other overallchange.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old male with squamous cell CA of tongue, with recurrent
disease and evidence of metastases and recent spread to spine
who presented with worsnening dyspnea on exertion and weight
loss.

The patient's chief reason for presenting to the ICU was
multifactorial hypoxia due to his COPD, CHF, pleural effusion
and probable aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  On presentation
he was started on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
Nevertheless he continued to have worsening of his dyspnea and
sputum production and during the day of [**2156-1-11**] he was noted to
be increasingly hypoxic and his oxygen saturations were dropping
to the 80's on 6L NC.  He was switched to 100% NRB and
maintained sats in the 90's on that but appeared to be tiring
and was transferred to the ICU on [**2156-1-11**].  At that point a blood
gas revealed profound respiratory acidosis and he was then
intubated for ventilatory failure.  The patient has treated with
vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for aspiration/HAP and was
gently diuresed.  No microbiologic diagnosis of the patient's
pneumonia was ever made and despite BAL no organisms were ever
isolated.  On [**2156-1-13**] a thoracentesis was performed to evaluate
for complicated effusion and this showed sterile inflammatory
fluid consistent with parapneumonic effusion.  The patient did
improve somewhat allowing some weaning of ventilatory settings
and acutally self extubated on [**2156-1-14**].  Unfortunately, after
extubation mental status remained poor and the patient became
progressively more hypercarbic requiring reintubation on [**2156-1-15**].
 On the morning of [**2156-1-16**] NIF was checked and was less than 30
suggesting generalized muscle weakness and high likelihood of
ventilatory failure if extubated.  With this information, and
given the patient had been reluctant to undergo chemotherapy in
the first place and had expressed a desire to not be permanently
sustained on artificial means, his husband and family decided to
terminally extubate the patient and make him comfortable.  He
was extubated on the evening of [**2156-1-16**] and gradually became more
hypoxic before expiring of respiratory failure.  His husband
declined autopsy.
