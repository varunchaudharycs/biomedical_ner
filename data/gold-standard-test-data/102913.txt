Imaging
ECG: ([**6-17**])
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior
fascicular block.
Inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes are primary and
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2120-5-17**]
inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes appear less prominent.
.
ECHO ([**6-18**])
PRE VALVE DEPLOYMENT The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The
remaining myocardial segments are mildly, globally depressed.
The right ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is more significant calcification of the base
of the posterior mitral leaflet and posterior mitral annulus.
Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
POST VALVE DEPLOYMENT At initail deployment, the patient
developed near cardiac arrest with right ventricular akinesis.
The aortic valve was quickly replaced and epinephrine was given
with resolution of right ventricular failure. The right
ventriclular function then returned to the pre-deployment state.
The mitral regurgitation was worsened and severe immediately
after this event but after valve replacement returned to
baseline (mild to moderate). The aortic valve and supporting
structure is in situ. The leaflets can be seen moving. The
maximum gradient across the valve was 7 mmHg with a mean of 4
mmHg. There is mild aortic regurgitation with two paravalvular
jets seen.
.
ECG ([**6-18**])
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm.
Since the
previous tracing of the same date ventricular paced rhythm is
now present.
TRACING #2
.
CXR ([**6-18**])
A CoreValve is in place. The left-sided pacemaker with the leads
terminating at right atrium and right ventricle is noted. Lungs
are essentially clear. Heart size and mediastinal silhouette are
stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted.
.
ECHO ([**6-20**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to
jypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, and
posterior wall. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. A paravalvular aortic valve leak
(trace-to-mild) is probably present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CXR ([**6-20**])
IMPRESSION: Very satisfactory postoperative situation. Permanent
pacer with two intracavitary electrodes in unremarkable
position. No pneumothorax identified.
.
ECHO ([**6-25**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal inferoseptal, inferior, and
inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is
present and appears well-seated. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen (probably paravalvular). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-6-20**],
left ventricular systolic function appears similar. Left
ventricular ejection fraction may have been slightly
underestimated in the prior report. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher. Mitral regurgitation is now
more prominent. Tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent.
.
ECG ([**6-25**])
Ventricular paced rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. No
diagnostic
change compared to previous tracing.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yo M with a PMH significant for critical AS, CABG x4
and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 82473**] for percutaneous aortic valve
replacement with CoreValve device.

#1 Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis s/p CoreValve [**6-18**]:
At initail deployment, the patient developed near cardiac arrest
with right ventricular akinesis. The aortic valve was quickly
replaced and epinephrine was given with resolution of right
ventricular failure. The right ventriclular function then
returned to the pre-deployment state. The mitral regurgitation
was worsened and severe immediately after this event but after
valve replacement returned to baseline (mild to moderate).
Perioperative permanent pacemaker placed following occlusion of
RCA, has right BBB and paced beats. ECHO shows good valve
placement and mild perivalvular leak. One unit PRBC given post
procedure for low hct. Pt will need aspirin and Plavix for a
total of 3 months and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32655**] NP for routine post procedure care.
.
#2 Complete Heart Block during CoreValve placement: common
occurance in patients with right bundle branch block. A
[**Company 1543**] DDD pacemaker model Sensia SEDR01,
serial number [**Serial Number 82474**]. One week wound check and
interrogation occurred while pt was still hospitalized and pt
will need to f/u every 6 months for a pacemaker check.

#3 CAD: s/p CABG x 4 ([**2112**]). Bypass graft angiography
demonstrates  the vein graft to the obtuse marginal and the LIMA
to LAD to be  patent, however during CoreValve procedure the RCA
graft was TO. Pt had no significant chest pain during
hospitalization and was discharged on home aspirin, plavix,
metoprolol and Lipitor.
.
#4 Chronic Systolic Dysfunction: EF 35%. Appeared euvolemic at
discharge.
Had not been on ACEi [**1-24**] AS and [**Last Name (un) **]. Would consider starting low
dose ACEi as outpatient. Started Lasix 20 mg PO for inc TR
gradient.
.
# Diarrhea. Possibly due to antibiotics and bowel regimen. No
fever or leukocytosis. Resolved at discharge.
.
# Skin [**Last Name (un) 1994**]. Likely secondary to prednisone. Mild serosanguinous
oozing at site. Wound nurse [**First Name (Titles) 6349**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1994**] and wrote
recommendations to VNA for dressing.
.
#. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: On chronic steroids at home,
continued in hospital.
.
#. CKD: baseline creatinine 1.5. Increased to 1.6, possibly
secondary to intravascular depletion from diuresis/diarrhea. Pt
will have his labs rechecked as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You had a percutaneous replacement of your aortic valve with a
CoreValve bioprosthetic valve. You will need to take asprin and
Plavix for 3 months to prevent blood clots around the valve. Do
not stop taking aspirin and Plavix unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you it
is OK to do so. You also needed a pacemaker after the procedure
for a slow heart rhythm, you will need to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11250**] and
an electrophysiology doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Location (un) 3844**] to have the
pacemaker checked every 6 months. No lifting more than 5 pounds
with your left arm or lift your left arm over your head for 6
weeks. There are no activity restrictions for your right arm.
You can shower when you get home. You needed a blood transfusion
for anemia, your blood count is better now. You heart is
slightly weaker now than before. You need to watch your salt
intake and take all of your medicines daily. Information
regarding your medicines and diet was discussed with you before
discharge.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 11250**] if weight goes
up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. Stop taking Atenolol, take metoprolol instead to lower your
heart rate and help your heart pump better
2. Start taking plavix every day to prevent blood clots on the
new valve.
