Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia; seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled dialysis line placement
Central venous line placement and removal
Peripherally-inserted central catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD
(MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with
residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to
the ED s/p seizure. Patient denies having seizure activity
though brought in after [**2-25**] witnessed seizures at his day
program. Unclear what day nurses saw at the rehab or if he fell.
Patient denies headache, blurry vision, numbness, tingling,
weakness of his extremities. He is a poor historian as he does
not speak much at baseline. Patient states he's been taking his
Keppra as prescribed.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.5 58 131/78 18 100%. Exam notable for
left sided deficits, speech slow and minimal (reported
baseline). EKG: NSR at 58, LAD, TWI II, [**Month/Day (3) 1105**], AVF, V4-V6, c/w
prior. Lytes showed K 5.4, Cr 8.4, lactate 0.9. CBC with WBC 3.0
(mildly decreased from baseline), Hct 38 (up from baseline mid
30s) plts 104 (at baseline). A left central line was placed for
access. In the ED, line was placed given BG dropped to 35, given
1 amp dextrose, and BG improved to 130. Per ED d/w daughter, pt
has no h/o diabetes and has multiple episodes of hypoglycemia in
the past that has reportedly been worked up by endocrinology
without known etiology. CXR showed no acute process, and CT head
without acute process. Per Epilepsy attending, recommended
change Keppra to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] abd 500mg after HD, and recommended
sending a Keppra level. Blood cultures were sent x1, no urine
sent as pt does not make urine.
VS prior to transfer 97.9, 59, 118/61, 16, 96%r/a.
.
On the floors, pt triggered for hypoglycemia with FS 47. Please
see trigger note for further details. Pt denies lightheadedness,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. He denies having a seizure today
and cannot recall and falls or shaking episodes. He says that he
has been feeling well. He is unsure of the last time he ate, but
knows he did not have dinner. He says his daughter helps him eat
at home.
.
Attempted to call daughter, but no answer initially. Eventually
able to contact her, and reportedly had seizure today per
daycare, [**Last Name (un) 35689**] House in Endleson Day care. Unsure if they
checked his BG there. On no hypoglycemics. She recalls that all
his food is pureed given his dysphagia.
.
Pt had a recent admission from [**Date range (3) 63593**] for possible
seizure and found to have RLL, discharged on Levofloxacin.
.
ROS: Per HPI.
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath,
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia.

IMAGING:

CT head w/o [**2112-11-10**]:
No acute intracranial process. Stable bilateral
encephalomalacia.
.
CT Neck [**2112-11-10**] 1. No fracture or subluxation.
2. Apparent degenerative changes at C5-6 with probable endplate
Schmorl's
nodes which appear similar, although somewhat progressed since
the prior MR study. Posterior disc osteophyte complex at C5-6
and disc bulge at C6-7
slightly indent the thecal sac. Anterior disc space widening at
C6-7 is
chronic.
3. Right thyroid enlargement which slightly indents the trachea.

.
CXR [**2112-11-10**]:
FINDINGS: AP and lateral upright radiographs of the chest were
obtained.
There are moderately low lung volumes. The previously seen right
lower lung opacity has improved, but not completely resolved and
may reflect residual atelectasis or infection. The previously
described right paratracheal fullness is stable and is
attributable to tortuous vessels as seen on prior CT studies.
Trachea is stably narrowed at the level of the thoracic inlet
and is attributable to tortuous vessels as noted on CT torso.
There is stable cardiomegaly. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: Improvement in right lower lung
opacity which has not completely resolved and may reflect
residual atelectasis or infection.
.
CXR line placement [**2112-11-10**]:
FINDINGS: There is a newly placed left internal jugular catheter
with the tip positioned in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax is
present. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. The cardiac
silhouette, hilar, and mediastinal contours appear stable.
.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory central line position without
pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
.
CT-torso ([**2112-11-22**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right perinephric and retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Small right pleural effusion with consolidated portions of
the right
middle and lower lobes containing hyperdense material suggesting
aspiration as a possible etiology.
.
CT-head ([**2112-11-24**]):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Again noted are large, bilateral ares of encephalomalacia in the
MCA territory is present since [**2107**], likely due to old infarcts.
A small right cerebellar hypodensity is again noted. The
ventricles and sulci are enlarged, likely due to a combination
of age-related atrophy and prior infarctions. No fractures are
identified.

Line placements by IR ([**2112-12-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful placement of a 4 French single-lumen PICC via the
left basilica vein approach, terminating at the cavoatrial
junction. The line is ready for use.
2. Successful conversion of a temporary catheter for a tunneled
15.5 French dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter via the left IJ
approach, with the tip terminating within the right atrium. The
line is ready for use.
3. Left arm venogram demonstrating marked tortuosity at the
basillic-axillary junction and a diminutive cephalic vein. All
visualized veins are patent


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD
(MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with
residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to
the ED s/p seizure and hypoglycemia. Course was complicated by
RP bleed, s/p IR embolization of R renal artery [**2112-11-17**], PNA
s/p course of Vanc/Zosyn/Tobra, and inability to clear his own
secretions with subsequent recurrent mucus plugging and chronic
aspiration, leading to episodes of hypoxic respiratory distress.
.
# Seizures: The patient had a witnessed event in which he had
whole-body shaking and was non-responsive. DDx for seizure
precipitant includes metabolic etiology such as [**2-24**] hypoglycemia
vs. infection vs. medication non-compliance. Not likely acute
intracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o. No reason to
believe that the patient has been missing his medications, per
family and daycare. He has no complaints, and no s/s of
infection (no fever, symptoms, and CXR w/no focal infiltrate),
which could also precipitate seizures. Per reviewing [**Name (NI) **], pt has
been admitted frequently for these seizures every few months.
The ED [**Name (NI) 653**] pt's outpt Neurologist who recommended
increasing Keppra dose to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing 500mg after
HD and checking a level.  Keppra level was obtained but pending
as it is a send out. Oxcarbazepine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] continued.
Treatment of hypoglycemia as below.
.
# Hypoglycemia: Pt presented with significant hypoglycemia of
unknown etiology. There is no evidence of iatrogenic cause of
hypoglycemia.  Workup included fasting C-peptide and insulin
level, which were non-diagnostic given the venous glucose for
the specimen was not less than 50.  There was no evidence of
adrenal insufficiency.  His hypoglycemia resolved after RP bleed
for unclear reasons.
.
# Aspiration: Pt has a documented history of chronic aspiration
likely secondary to his CVA, and has been evaluated by speech
and swallow multiple times in the past.  Pt was found to be at
increased risk for aspiration.  However, family in the past had
insisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk.
In [**Month (only) **], speech and swallow commented that "As aspiration
risks are similar across consistencies, pt comfort should be
deciding factor in diet order".  Pt was placed on mechanical
soft diet/dysphagia diet on admission, as quality of life was
considered to be the number one priority by the family.  During
this admission, pt was found to have significant worsening
aspiration, manifested by copious secretions in airway.  He had
multiple episodes of desatting both in the MICU and on the
regular floor.  He collapsed his right lung several times in the
setting of mucus plugging.  For all these episodes, he responded
well with suction and chest PT.  After lengthy discussion with
family, decision was made to feed the patient despite the
aspiration risk. A PEG tube was deferred given successful eating
without obvious aspiration.
.
# Fistula thrombosis/Access: Following his stay in the ICU the
patient had a thrombosed fistula.  The level of thrombosis was
too much for vascular or for IR to open the fistula.  He had a
temporary line placed that was converted to a tunneled catheter
for dialysis and IR was able to place a PICC for further access
via venogram.  He will be discharged on a heparin
drip-to-warfarin bridge for this thrombosis and a
catheter-associated thrombus in the right IJ.
.
# Line infection: The patient had pus noted around his right IJ
following his time in the ICU.  Cultures subsequently grew
resistant Klebsiella and coagulase negative gram positive cocci,
along with confirmation from 1 subsequent blood culture.  He
will be treated for a total of two weeks with vancomycin and
cefepime, to be completed on [**2112-12-20**].

# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent anemia: Pt was found to
have tachycardia and hypotension on HD#7, with a 9-point HCT
drop.  He underwent CTA, and was found to have multifocal
retroperitoneal bleed in the right kidney.  He was admitted to
MICU and intubated for airway protection.  Pt had a total of 9
units pRBC.  Transcatheter embolization of the right kidney was
performed and hemodynamic stability was achieved.  Subsequently,
his hematocrit continued to run low, requiring intermittent
transfusions of RBCs at dialysis, with a nadir of 19.9.
Nephrology will be assessing whether he should be started on
Epogen at dialysis.
.
# Pneumonia: Pt was found to have pneumonia on MICU day 4, with
leukocytosis and
fever.  The etiology of pneumonia was HCAP vs VAP.  He was
treated with vanco, zosyn and tobra for a total of 9 days.  His
WBC and fever resolved s/p antibiotics treatment.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# ESRD on HD: MWF, received dialysis on schedule.  Access is now
a tunneled line, given AVG thrombosis and he should be continued
on sevelamer and nephrocaps.
.
# Pancytopenia: Pt with macroycytic anemia and thrombocytopenia
prior. However, WBC mildly decreased at presentation to 3.0,
which is a change from prior. No s/s infection, CXR without
focal infiltrate as above.  B12 and folate were high.
.
# CAD/CVA history: ECG unchanged from prior. We initially
continued home aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and coumadin, but
the RP bleed complicated this regimen.  Once embolization was
done and hematocrit was deemed stable, multiple thromboses were
discovered in right IJ and RUE AVG.  Therefore, a heparin drip
was started and he was bridged to coumadin.
.
# Depression: on fluoxetine as listed discharge med but held on
discharge as it causes hypoglycemia and it can lower the seizure
threshold.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were admitted for seizure, which was likely in the setting
of hypoglycemia. You have often become hypoglycemic in the past
and it is unclear why this keeps happening. You were evaluated
for this but the results of the studies can be discussed in
outpatient follow up.
Because you continue to be hypoglycemic, it was felt that you
might be best served by placement in a long term care facility.


While in the hospital, you received hemodialysis per your normal
schedule.  You will continue to get hemodialysis as an
outpatient while you are in the long term care facility.

Please note the following changes to your medications:
STOP aspirin, since you will be on coumadin
STOP fluoxetine, as it can contribute to hypoglycemia
START coumadin, with dosing to be adjusted per your MDs
START heparin IV, dosing to be adjusted per your MDs
START cefepime and vancomycin to help fight bacteria in your
blood

Please be sure to follow up with your physicians as below.

Followup Instructions:
You will be seen by the doctors at the [**Name5 (PTitle) **]-term care facility.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your primary care doctor, will see you if you are
discharged from this facility.  Please feel free to call him
with any questions - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].

You should see your outpatient neurologist to continue managing
your anti-seizure medications.  Appointment information is
below:

Department: NEUROLOGY
When: [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] [**2113-1-6**] at 2:00 PM
