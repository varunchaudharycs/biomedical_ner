Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pleurex catheter


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with PMH of stage IV NSCLC, CVA, and a
recurrent malignant right sided pleural effusion who presented
after attempted IP procedure on day of admission with altered
mental status and an unresponsive episode.  Pt was scheduled for
outpatient pleuroscopy, pleurodesis, and PleurX Catheter
placement today.  She was prepped and received 75Mcg of Fentanyl
and 1.5 mg total of Midazolam.  An incision was made, but at
that time the patient became unresponsive with bradycardia into
the 30s and hypotension with SBPs in the 60s.  She required
ventilatory support with a BVM briefly, got Atropine 0.5mg x 2
and the procedure was aborted (and small incision sutured
closed).

She was given flumazenil 0.5mg as well as narcan 0.4mg with
minimal response.  She was not responding
verbally/appropriately. She was withdrawing to painful stimuli
and moving all extremities.  At the time of this incident, an
EKG was performed that showed atrial fibrillation and ST
depressions (reportedly in V2-V3).  Repeat EKG 30 minutes later
showed normalization of these abnormalities.

Prior to the procedure she reported cough, dyspnea, and weight
loss. She specifically denied orthopnea, PND or leg edema.

Of note, she has had thoracentesis x  2 on [**1-26**] and [**2-27**] draining
850ml and 1300ml respectively. Post procedure her dyspnea
improved and there was complete lung expansion.

On the floor, the patient is responsive to painful stimuli only.

Review of systems:
Unable to obtain due to patient's mental status.

Past Medical History:
1. CVA
2. Right-sided breast cancer:  This was about 30 years ago and
   treated with mastectomy and radiation therapy.
3. Type 2 diabetes:  Diet controlled.
4. Hypertension.
5. Atrial fibrillation.
6. Gout.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Osteopenia/osteoporosis.
9. Glaucoma.
10. NSCLC as below:
-[**10-7**] CXR for cough showed R-sided opacity, chest CT which
showed a nodular lesions in superior RLL and mod/large R pleural

effusion
- [**2118-11-2**] pleural effusion tapped and negative for malignancy
Pt then developed hoarseness and was seen by ENT [**1-8**] and
determined to have recurrent nerve paralysis, highly concerning
for malignancy.
- [**2119-1-13**] repeat imaging disclosed a smaller LUL nodule and
paratracheal mass, likely a lymph node conglomerage
- [**2119-1-26**] EBUS with FNA sampled paratracheal mass and lymph
node, both positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Brochial brushings of the right lobar bronchi were atypical
- [**2119-2-9**]: C1D1 09-018: irreversible EGFR/ErbB2 TKI PF-[**Numeric Identifier 108198**]

Social History:
The patient currently lives with her family in [**Location (un) 2312**], she
has VNA 2X/week. She is originally from the [**Country 31115**] but
moved here in [**2081**] and has not been back there recently. She
previously lived in [**Location 86**] and then moved to [**State 108**] and has now
been back up in [**Location (un) 86**] for the last 2 years. She denies any
other areas of residence. She denies any alcohol use and she
denies any past or present cigarette smoking. However, her
husband was a significant smoker. The patient previously worked
for the Red Cross and had no occupational exposures. Family very
involved in her care.

CXR (portable): [**2119-4-6**]
CHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, with increased left lower lobe
atelectasis and a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Right lower
lobe atelectasis and subpulmonic effusion persist. Hazy opacity
in the right upper lobe corresponds to known primary tumor. Left
upper lobe nodule is vaguely seen overlying the second anterior
and fourth posterior ribs. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and
aortic tortuosity persist. The stomach is markedly distended,
with PEG tube in place. IMPRESSION: 1. Bibasilar atelectasis,
tiny left pneumothorax. 2. Distended stomach, please decompress
through PEG tube.

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2119-4-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. 1.4 cm calcified left paraclinoid lesion most consistent with
meningioma without associated edema.
3. Areas of hypodensity within the right parietal and right
frontal regions corresponding to FLAIR abnormalities on prior
MRI and consistent with remote infarcts.
.
MRI Head [**2119-4-7**]: No acute pathology (prelim)
.
CXR [**2119-4-7**] (post Pleurex):
No evidence of residual pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness/altered
mental status was possibly due to versed/fentanyl with slow
metabolism, but also possibly due to hypoxia and resultant CNS
insult that occurred as a result of her hypoperfusion with low
HR and blood pressure.  Alternative explanations include CVA and
other toxic/metabolic abnormalities. Glucose level was normal.
As this change in level of consciousness was so acute, less
likely due to infection/sepsis.  Patient also with long history
of atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation with an
INR of 1.2. The patient was admitted to the SICU under the care
of the MICU team.  Her airway was monitored closely and she had
a repeat ABG that showed 7.4/65/127.  She did not receive any
further opiates/benzodiazepines.  Her mental status was waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], and she would have periods throughout the night
where she would open her eyes and follow simple commands
(squeeze hands).  Otherwise, she was responsive only to painful
stimuli.  An MRI of her brain was performed due to concern for
embolic CVA which showed no acute pathology.  She did receive
flumazenil 0.5mg again along with narcan 0.4mg.  Approximately
one hour after the administration of these medicines, the
patient was fully awake, alert and oriented. On the day
following admission, she was able to converse with her family
(present at bedside) although she frequently reported feeling
"tired."  She later tolerated her IP procedure well and was
alert on discharge.

# Hypotension: When the patient first arrived to the ICU, her
blood pressures were in the high 90s and low 100s systolic.
Over the subsequent several hours, her blood pressures drifted
down to a nadir of 70s systolic. She received 2 IV fluid boluses
of 500ml.  She showed improvement in her blood pressure to
90s-100s.  A central line set up was at bed side in case
pressors were needed, but her blood pressure remained stable and
then increased to 120s systolic when she became fully awake.
During this time her UOP remained satisfactory, averaging
30ml/hour.

# EKG changes: The patient had EKG changes during her initial
bradycardic/hypotensive episode with new RBBB and minimal ST
depressions in V2-V3. A repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed
resolution of these findings and only showed atrial fibrillation
with no ST/T wave abnormalities. The patient does not carry the
diagnosis of CAD, but is a diabetic and is predisposed to
vascular abnormalities.  As a result cardiac enzymes were
cycled.  A second set did show a small increase in troponin T to
0.02, but no MB component. Third set of enzymes was negative.

# NSCLC with pleural effusion: Patient is now status post 2
cycles with investigatory drug, now with reaccumulation of
pleural effusion.  The reaccumulation likely represents
progression of tumor. On the day following admission, she was
seen by IP and a PleurX catheter was placed at bedside with
drainage of 1100 cc of fluid. After the procedure, the patient
reported feelling "much better." F/U chest x-ray showed no PTX.
She was called out to the general medical wards after this
procedure. She was discharged the following day with no acute
issues.

# DM 2: The patient's diabetes was generally diet controlled,
here with glucose range 150-250.  She was maintained on a RISS.

# Afib: Atenolol was discontinued given her hypotension. Pt's
heart rate was stable prior to discharge.

# Hypothyroidism: A TSH was sent and was elevated at 7.8,
however, a free T4 was normal at 1.6. Te patient was maintained
on her home dose levothyroxine via PEG daily.

# Code status: The patient expressed wishes to be DNR/DNI during
this admission. This decision was discussed with her daughter at
bedside. The patient was provided with a DNR/DNI form to
complete should she require future documentation of this
decision. Patient was discharged home with VNA. The family did
not want hospice but VNA will be there to assist them and help
make the patient comfortable. Palliative care was also consulted
this admission to help with planning.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108197**],
You were seen and evaluated for low blood pressure and a period
of unresponsiveness in the hospital after a planned pulmonary
procedure.

Your unresponsiveness was likely due to the medications you
received for sedation in the procedure, and you are probably an
individual who breaks down these medicines very slowly.

You were monitored closely in the intensive care unit and
received fluid resuscitation for your low blood pressure. You
also underwent the planned procedure, which involved placing a
tube in your chest to drain the fluid. You tolerated the
procedure well.

As you may be aware, you had a discussion with our palliative
care team, and decided that you did not want to be recussitated.
You also indicated that your goals of care were geared towards
comfort, but did not want to be set up with home hospice care.

We made the following changes to your medication regimen: We
stopped you blood pressure medications, including atenolol and
hydrochlorothiazide, since you had low blood pressure. Should
your blood pressure at home be elevated, and should you choose
to treat this condition, you may contact your regular doctor to
restart these medications. We also are giving you medication in
case you develop constipation, i.e. loperamide, or diarrhea,
i.e. colace, senna, bisacodyl; all of which may be taken on an
as needed basis. Finally we are giving you morphine, to take
sublingually, in case you have shortness of breath or pain.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
