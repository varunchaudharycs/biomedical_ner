Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo man hypertension admitted with angioedema.

1. Angioedema: Likely related to either shellfish/lisinopril
exposure.  Was admitted to the MICU for respiratory observation.
 Patient was evaluated by ENT who saw glottis and soft tissue

He was transferred to the floor.  Over the course of 48hrs his
symptoms resolved, confirmed on repeat laryngoscopy.  He
tolerated POs well.  He was discharged with specific
instructions to avoid shellfish/seafood as well as lisinopril.
He was discharged with a rapid prednisone taper over 5 days, as
well as famotidine and diphenhydramine.  JHe has ENT and PCP
follow up, and would benefit from allergy follow up to further
establish a cause.
