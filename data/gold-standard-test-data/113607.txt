IMPRESSIONS:
1. Wall thickening and stranding along the colon from the
splenic flexure
through the sigmoid colon, similar to that seen on [**2125-8-1**].
Findings again
represent nonspecific colitis, possibly ischemic, infectious or
inflammatory
in etiology. No free air, definite abscess, pneumatosis, or
portal gas seen.

   FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2125-9-14**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA
FOUND.

   CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2125-9-15**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER
FOUND.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2125-9-13**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Doctor Last Name **] KITCHEN ON [**2125-9-13**] AT 1:10PM.
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).


Brief Hospital Course:
C. difficile colitis/Sepsis: Given history of recurrent C.
difficile colitis, diarrhea, and sepsis, etiology was presumed
to be CDAD, confirmed on stool cx.  She was started on PO vanco,
IV flagyl empirically.  CT scan demonstrated colitis.  Patient
was admitted to the ICU for aggressive IVF, though patient
refused central line.  She was briefly on peripheral levophed.
ID and GI were consulted.  After adequate resuscitation, she
stabilized clinically and was transferred to the medical floor.
Her diarrhea improved, though her flagyl was stopped after she
developed parasthesias.  Reviewing the record, it appeared that
she stopped her previous taper early.  Therefore, a more
aggressive taper was pursued, deferring possible fecal
transplantation to the outpatient setting, as well as rifamixin.
.
ARF: Likely pre-renal.  Resolved with IVF resusitation
.
h/o DVT: Coumadin was reversed initially.  However, once she
stabilized it was restarted with lovenox bridge.  She will need
close follow up to ensure her coumadin returns to therapeutic
range 2-3 and was dicharged on warfarin 4mg daily and lovenox
40mg SC q12 to bridge
.
Plexopathy: Continued coumadin
.
HTN, benign: will restart home antihypertensives on discharge
.
Chronic diastolic CHF: was euvolemic on exam.  Continued home
medications
