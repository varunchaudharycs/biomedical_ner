History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 99778**] is a 41 year old female a history of warm
autoantibody hemolytic anemia diagnosed in [**2150**] who recently
underwent laparoscopic splenectomy on [**2154-2-20**] for disease
refractory to steroids, and refractory to rituximab and
cyclosporin. She tolerated the procedure well but has been
fatigued but has been experiencing abdominal pain since surgery
which is poorly controlled with Percocet. She has also felt
fatigued and dyspneic, consistent with prior episodes of
hemolysis. Because of her abdominal pain and fatigue she has not
been eating well and has not taken her cyclosporin for
approximately 2 days.

She initially presented with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital with
abdominal pain. She was found to have a WBC count of 30 and a
hematocrit of 10. On [**2154-2-26**] her WBC count was 13.4 with a
hematoctit of 25.1. She underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which
showed no evidence of acute bleeding or other etiology of her
abdominal pain. She received 4 units of non-crossmatched PRBCs
and solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

On arrival to the emergency room her initial vitals were T: 98.1
BP: 118/55 HR: 97 RR: 21 O2: 99% RA. She was evaluated by the
surgical service who reviewed the OSH CT scan and did not feel
that there was a surgical cause of her pain. She received 6 mg
IV Dilaudid for pain and 4 mg IV zofran.

On review of systems she endorses chills at home but did not
take her temperature. She denies chest pain or pressure. She
endorses dyspnea with exertion, lightheadedness, and fatigue.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2154-3-3**]:
1. Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver related to thrombosis of
the right portal vein, main portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV.
Note is made of thrombus extending into extensive
retroperitoneal collaterals.
2. Abnormal bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon,
which may
relate to venous congestion.
3. Patent hepatic veins, in arterial system. No IVC thrombosis.
4. Gas in the soft tissues of the left anterior abdominal wall.
Recommend clinical correlation with recent surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 99778**] is a 41 year old female with warm autoimmune
hemolytic anemia who presented ten days status-post splenectomy
with abdominal pain and dyspnea with a hematocrit of 11 and some
evidence of hemolysis.

Anemia: Her laboratories at OSH were consistent with but not
diagnostic of hemolysis; she did not display signs of active
bleeding. The haptoglobin at [**Hospital1 18**] was elevated pointing against
hemolysis. Given her low hematocrit. She was initially managed
in the ICU. A CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed extensive clot burden in
her portal system, likely related to her prior surgery. She
received four units of major antibody crossmatched blood, and
additional tubes were sent to the Red Cross for further
crossmatching.

Hematology saw the patient in the emergency room, and
recommended treatment with steroids and cyclosporine. She was
started on Solumedrol 80mg IV daily and Cyclosporine 150mg PO
q12hours. Hemolysis labs were monitored as well as Cyclosporine
levels. The Surgical team also followed the patient in the ICU.
After transfer to the medical floor, Hct gradually rose daily to
36.6 at time of discharge. Solumedrol was tapered and converted
to prednisione. Cyclosporine was also tapered to 75mg [**Hospital1 **]. LDH
was persistently elevated likely secondary to abdominal clot
process. F/u was scheduled with her hemtologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**].

Abdominal Pain/Portal thrombus: The pain was diffuse, severe,
and out of proportion to exam. CT scan of abdomen did show large
portal clot burden. Empiric metronidazole was started until a
C.diff could be obtained, but as pt did not have a BM, it was
continued until day of discharge. Her pain was controlled with
Dilaudid as needed.  Her diet was advanced to regular, but on
the day of discharge (against medical advice), she did not
tolerate jello without IV dilaudid.  Plan was for pt to remain
until able to tolerate clears with only po pain meds, but she
chose to leave AMA (form signed). She has f/u scheduled with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] within one week. Expressed understanding of need to
return if abdominal pain increases. Given 5 days worth of home
dose of percocet.

Thrombocytosis:  Likely related to recent splenectomy, improved
from 1.5 million to 900K at time of d/c.

Leukocytosis: Likely reactive process + related to high dose
steroids. No fevers.  No localizing sources of infection with
the exception of abdominal pain. She was started on empiric
Flagyl which was discontinued at time of discharge. White count
peaked at 36 and fell to 17.5 at time of discharge.

Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine 1.3 from baseline < 1.0. The
was felt to most likely be prerenal from dehydration. This
returned to baseline prior to d/c.
.
Hypertension: likely secondary to steroids and cyclosporine. not
stating anti-htn at this time, continue to monitor; should
improve with taper. BPs peaking in the 170/80 range at time of
discharge.
.
Anxiety: The patient was noted to be very anxious, and this
seemed to worsen after the initiation of steroids. There is
concern that the steroid is causing side effects, including
psychosis, as it had done in the past according to the patient.
She was continued on home benzodiazepines (Klonopin), as well as
Haldol PRN. Disscharged on home klonopin dose.

***PT DISCHARGED AMA.  Our recommendation was that she stay
until being able to tolerate po with only percocet for pain
control. She signed AMA form and expressed understanding of
risks.

without IV dilaudid at the time of discharge.


Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with severe abdominal pain and a very
low blood count. You received a blood transfusion at an outside
hospital and another one here.  At the time of discharge, your
blood counts were nearing the normal range.  A scan of your
abdomen showed a large amount of blood clots in the vessels that
drain your intestines.  For this, you will need to be
anticoagulated for some time.

You are being discharged against medical advice.  We strongly
advise you to stay until you were able to tolerate food without
IV pain medication.  There is a risk that advancing your diet
without medical supervision may lead to an acute abdomen process
requiring urgent intervention.

Please return to the hospital if you develop: severe abdominal
pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dizziness, blood in your stool,
tarry stools, any other form of bleeding, severe headache,
chenage in vision, or any other symptom which seriously concerns
you.

Several changes were made to your medications:
- cyclosporin has been reduced to 75mg twice daily
- prednisone 30mg daily has been started
- warfarin 5mg daily has been started
- bactrim (single strength) has been started
- omeprazole, paroxeteine, clonazepam, calcium/vitamin D, and
folic acid have been continued at previous doses.

Followup Instructions:
We have scheduled you an appointment with [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],
MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2359**] Date/Time:[**2154-3-14**] at 11:45am

Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 7750**] office today and make an appointment
for Tuesday [**3-12**].  It is very important that you make this
appointment, you will need to have your INR (blood thinning)
checked.
