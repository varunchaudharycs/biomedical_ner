Chief Complaint:
Evaluation for liver transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. EGD
2. Post-pyloric feeding tube x 3
3. Paracentesis
4. PICC line placement x 2

History of Present Illness:
45F with ESLD secondary to EtOH, AIHA due to lasix recently on
prednisone who was initially presented to OSH with hepatic
encephalopathy transferred from OSH on [**5-27**] for liver transplant
evaluation whose course has been complicated by coagulopathy
with recurrent epistaxis, VRE bacteremia, new onset Afib with
RVR and now with worsening leukocytosis and diffuse bilat
pulmonary infiltrates.
.
To summarize her recent course, the patient was admitted to OSH
from [**Date range (1) 74368**] for hemolytic anemia thought to be [**1-15**] lasix and
was started on prednisone 50mg. On [**5-22**], she represented with
hepatic encephalopathy and T [**Age over 90 **]F where she underwent
paracentesis with negative cultures. CXR showed b/l infiltrates
and she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for liver transplant eval.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was noted to have numerous small pulmonary nodules
on [**5-29**] chest CT of unclear significance. Pulm consulted for
?bronch given concern for infection vs. malignancy. Due to
worsening confusion the patient underwent repeat paracentesis
with 135 WBC. Eventually blood cultures from [**6-11**] returned [**12-17**]
bottles +ve for VRE and was started on daptomycin. Likely source
was colonization of urine discovered on [**5-30**]. Also on [**6-11**], the
patient was started on CTX for positive U/A which was then
continued per ID to empirically cover possible SBP. Also treated
for hepatorenal syndrome (cre 1.5 which improved to 0.4) with
albumin, midodrine, and octreotide x 4 days, which was d/c'd on
[**6-16**] given improvement in renal function.
.
On [**6-14**], the patient developed significant epistaxis requiring
multiple FFP, platelet, and RBC transfusions. There was concern
for aspiration given altered mental status. Despite continued G+
black stools her Hct has been stable since [**6-15**]. On [**6-16**], the
medical team repeated her CT chest to eval for progression of
pulmonary nodules and found bilateral infiltrates concerning for
infection, bleeding, or aspiration. She was started on bactrim
for possible PCP given her recent prolonged predinsone course
that had been discontinued on [**6-15**]. Also on [**6-16**] developed
new-onset Afib with RVR 150s that responded to diltiazem. Due to
increased volume of diarrhea and climbing WBC count she was
started on empiric flagyl on [**2106-6-17**].
.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient denies any complaints
including shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, confusion.

RADIOLOGY:
=========
[**5-28**] ABD U/S- DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND: No prior studies are
available for comparison. The TIPS is patent with wall-to-wall
color flow. There is appropriate flow reversal (hepatofugal)
within the left portal vein. The assessment of the right
anterior and posterior portal veins was limited as the liver is
extremely shrunken and nodular. The following velocities were
obtained: Main portal vein 35 cm/sec; proximal TIPS 67 cm/sec;
mid TIPS 73 cm/sec; distal tips 74 cm/sec. The receiving hepatic
vein is patent.
.
There is a small amount of ascites surrounding the liver,
relatively less in the lower quadrants. The liver is extremely
shrunken and nodular with very heterogeneous echotexture.
Anterior to the TIPS stent are multiple tubular hypo-to-anechoic
structures which could represent dilated ducts or less likely,
thrombosed veins. No frank mass lesion is identified but
assessment is limited due to the shrunken appearance of the
liver. The spleen is within normal limits in size measuring 10.7
cm.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flows and appropriate
velocities as listed above.
2. Shrunken cirrhotic liver without overt hepatic mass.
Questionable biliary dilatation anterior to TIPS stent
.
[**5-29**] CT A/P-
IMPRESSION:

1. Numerous noncalcified subcentimeter nonspecific pulmonary
nodules. Comparison with prior CT scans if available is
recommended to evaluate for stability. If no prior examinations
are available for comparison, and the patient is a high risk
patient i.e. is a smoker or has a known primary malignancy, a
followup with CT of the chest in [**5-25**] months is recommended. If
the patient is at low risk i.e., is not a smoker or has no known
malignancy, followup with CT of the chest in twelve months is
recommended.

2. TIPS in the right hepatic lobe.

3. Chronic occlusion of the left portal vein and posterior
division of the right portal vein with corkscrew hepatic
arteries which are patent. There is a tiny left hepatic artery
off of the proper hepatic artery with an accessory branch off
the left gastric artery. No suspicious hepatic lesions.

4. Moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic ascites with
extensive intraabdominal varices as described consistent with
portal hypertension.
.
ECHO (TTE) [**2106-6-1**]-
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal/hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
.
Portable CXR [**6-4**]:
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  NG tube tip is below
the diaphragm out of view.  Right PICC line tip is in the mid
SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  New ill-defined opacity in the
left lower lobe in the
retrocardiac area is consistent with atelectasis and/or area of
aspiration
Small left pleural effusion is also new.
.
CT Chest [**6-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interim improvement in diffuse predominantly peribronchiolar
nodular
opacities, though numerous nodular opacities persist on the
current study. The coalescing airspace disease adjacent to the
minor fissure appears much
improved.  Given the improved appearance over the short
interval, an
infectious process is considered likely.  Eventual CT followup
(three months) is recommended after treatment.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate-to-large
ascites as well as subcutaneous edema are unchanged from the
prior exam.
.
Abdominal U/S [**6-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate to large amount of ascites.  A spot was marked for
paracentesis to be performed by the clinical service.
2.  _____ TIPS unchanged from the prior studies.
3.  Cirrhotic liver.  No focal lesions identified.
.
Portable CXR [**6-14**]:
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2106-6-12**]:
Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and new opacification
at the lung bases is probably a combination of atelectasis and
mild edema.  Pleural effusion is small, on the left, unchanged
acutely.  Heart size is top normal. Left PIC catheter ends at
the superior cavoatrial junction.  Esophageal tube and right PIC
line have been removed.
.
ECHO [**6-15**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function  is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is
likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2106-6-1**], the tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat
increased.
.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
.
[**6-16**] Chest CT
FINDINGS: Since the prior study there has been marked worsening
of the alveolar opacities involving both lungs, predominantly in
the upper zones. The periphery of the lungs is relatively
spared. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart
size appears slightly enlarged. There is no pericardial
effusion. There are borderline lymph nodes in the paratracheal
region measuring up to 9 mm in short axis. The central airways
are patent without endoluminal lesions. A left-sided PICC is
seen extending into the superior vena cava.
.
In the visualized upper abdomen again seen is a cirrhotic liver
with the TIPS shunt in place. There is a large amount of ascites
noted. Coils are noted in the region of the splenic vessels. The
osseous structures appear unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked worsening of bilateral extensive alveolar opacities
particularly centrally. The rapidity of development and
distribution is most concerning for pulmonary edema, however,
atypical infection or less likely pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be
excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Cirrhotic liver with a moderate amount of ascites and TIPS
shunt in place.
.
OTHER STUDIES:
==============
EGD [**2106-6-2**] -
Grade 1 esophageal varices
A trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube (8 fr) was placed to 120 cm.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo female with ESLD [**1-15**] EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS who presented
from OSH for liver transplant evaluation, recent severe
bleeding, who developed sepsis, DIC, and multiorgan failure. A
brief hospital course by problem is outlined below:
.
#Sepsis/DIC: The patient required multiple vasopressors to
maintain SvO2 >70 and MAP>60s. Lactate continued to rise and she
became progressively acidotic. End organ hypoperfusion was
demonstrated by anuria. She was treated broadly with antibiotics
and aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin for
intravascular volume support and to correct her underlying
coagulopathy. HCO3 was utilized prn given worsening acidosis.
The patient was made CMO after an extensive family discussion
regarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired after
removal of vasopressors and respiratory support.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Progressively worsening bilateral lung
infiltrates resulting in hypoxia requiring intubation.
Differential included DAH given coagulopathy, infection (e.g.
PCP/fungal given recent course of steroids), or TRALI (though
unlikely). She was afebrile with rapidly progressive
leukocytosis. The patient was treated with steroids and bactrim
for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 74369**] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to cover
mycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Given worsening
infiltrates and P/F ratio suggestive of ARDS, she was ventilated
on ARDSnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowed
permissive hypercapnea.
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr progressively worsened in the setting
of sepsis and the patient became anuric. Differential included
HRS, ATN [**1-15**] renal hypoperfusion, prerenal [**1-15**] hypoalbuminemia
and 3rd spacing. She was unable to take po octreotide, midodrine
due to increased GI secretions and poor absorption. Attempted to
increased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products.
Pressors were utilized to maintain renal perfusion. The patient
developed a severe lactic acid metabolic acidosis due to tissue
hypoxia requiring HCO3 pushes.
.
# ETOH Cirrhosis: Decompensated liver disease s/p TIPS, with
hepatic encephalopathy, coagluapathy, elevated Tbili,
hyponatremia. On admission, aldactone held given hyponatremia
and hypotension. Lasix held given auto-immune hemolytic anemia.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic
encephalopathy. Ultrasound perfomed on admission and showed
patent TIPS, cirrhotic liver, no hepatoma. Diagnostic
paracentesis was performed, and was negative for SBP.
.
During hospitalization, she was evaluated for liver transplant,
and was transiently placed on the transplant list but was
removed after becoming septic. TTE showed a hyperdynamic EF,
with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease.
Liver CT completed. PFT's performed, with noted mild diffusion
abnormality. Chest CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below)
which were stable on repeat CT chest one week later.  Chest CT
from [**2106-6-16**] showed marked worsening (see below).
.
Hospitalization was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome.  HRS improved after
midodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia near
baseline of 127-129.  She was fluid restricted, but continued to
have worsening peripheral edema; diuretics were held given her
recently diagnosed AIHA [**1-15**] lasix.
.
# Arrhythmia: The patient had two asymptomatic episodes of
stable Vtach on the floor. On [**2106-6-16**], pt developed atrial
fibrillation to 160's.  She was converted with lopressor and
diltiazam, but then reverted to Afib/flutter rate-controlled on
diltiazem.  On transfer to the MICU, she had bursts of atrial
flutter with variable block and rate-dependent bundle branch
block.  She remained asymptomatic but nodal agents were held
given hypotension.
.
# Leukocytosis: Initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outside
hospital treated with a course of IV antibiotics. Upon admission
to [**Hospital1 18**], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood,
urine and stool cultures. Although pulmonary nodules were seen
on chest CT, this was not felt to represent an acute infectious
process given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection,
therefore no further antibiotics were given.  Acute alcoholic
hepatitis was considered as a possible cause of leukocytosis,
however there was no recent alcohol use to go along with this
diagnosis.
.
On [**6-5**], UCx with VRE.  On [**6-11**], pt's blood cultures positive
for VRE.  Felt that PICC line was possible source; however,
wound tip culture showed no growth.  She was started on
daptomycin and ceftriaxone per ID.  Echocardiogram was negative
for vegetation.  On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for
further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the
interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be
consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off
steroids for AIHA only days earlier. She was started emperically
on treatment doses of bactrim however she continued to worsen.
Diagnostic bronchoscopy was considered upon transfer to the ICU
however the patient was too unstable for the procedure. Flagyl
also emperically started for C. diff.
.
# Coagulopathy: [**1-15**] liver disease. Pt has had multiple red blood
cell transfusions, FFP, cryo, and platelets during admission.
Also received ddAVP for uremic platelets.  She had an episode of
profuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from Doboff feeding
tube that could only be controlled with packing, Afrin and
pressure by ENT.  She also bled from her paracentesis site,
requiring transfusion and sutures. She developed DIC and diffuse
mucosal bleeding after becoming septic.
.
# Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia: Diagnosed with auto-immune
hemolytic anemia at outside hospital, felt to be secondary to
lasix. Re-consulted hematology here who agreed with this
diagnosis. Lasix was held during admission and repeat coombs
antibody negative. Reticulocyte count high on admission (29%),
with elevated LDH, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestive
of ongoing hemolysis. However, hemolysis indices improved on
prednisone, and slow prednisone taper initiated as indices
stabilized. Blood counts supported as needed with blood
transfusions (for hgb <7 given difficult crossmatch (she has two
antibodies).
.
# GI: EGD performed on this admission demonstrated grade 1
esophageal varices, a trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube, and
otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
