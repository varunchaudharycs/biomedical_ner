Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
flushing, periorbital edema, and hives during CT scan

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. ERCP


History of Present Illness:
47 YO Caucasian male with Hx of chronic pancreatitis admitted
following an anaphylactoid reaction in CT scan.  Today, the
patient went for ERCP to further evaluate his pancreatitis.  The
ventral pancreatic duct was normal in caliber.  The pancreastic
duct in the area of the head of the pancreas was very dilated,
and contained multiple stones.  There was no filling of the
pancreatic duct beyond the head.  There were no lesions amenable
to endoscopic therapy.
The patient went for a CTA pancreas to rule out pancreatic
neoplasm b/c of elevated CEA and CA19-9.  The patient received
IV contrast and developed flushing, periorbital/facial edema and
hives.  Code Blue was called and the patient was given IV
benadryl, solumedrol, and H2 blocker.  The patient maintained
his O2 sats >100% on a 100% NRB, and BP had MAP>60.  The patient
was able to speak without difficulty and was x-ferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring.

Abd CT:  Area of atelectasis is seen in the right lung base.
There is no pleural effusion. The liver and spleen are not
enlarged. Ther is mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The
CBD measures up to 10 mm. The gallbladder, kidneys, and both
adrenals are unremarkable. There are multiple coarse
calcifications throughout the head and body of the pancreas.
Mild dilatation of the pancreatic main duct. In the head of the
pancreas, there is a septated cystic region measuring 12 x 15 mm
that could correspond with dilated side branches of the duct, or
IPMT. This region doesn't enhance following the administration
of the IV contrast. The pancreas appears irregular. There is no
free fluid or free air within the abdomen. The aorta is normal
in caliber. The bowel loops appear unremarkable.

ERCP:
1. The distal pancreatic duct within the head and neck of the
pancreas is markedly dilated with multiple filling defects
consistent with stones. The pancreatic duct proximally within
the body and tail of the pancreas cannot be opacified.
2. Normal-appearing ventral pancreatic duct.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anaphylaxis:  the pt had anaphylactoid reaction to IV
contrast dye during CT as evidenced by acute onset of flushing,
periorbital/facial edema, and hives.  He was treated in the CT
suite with IV benadryl, and was observed to maintain O2 sat 100%
on NRB and had MAP>60 at all times.  He was admitted to the ICU
for ongoing care, and was treated with standing doses of IV
benadryl, famotidine, and solumedrol overnight.  The pt had
stable respiratory status and BP throughout his admission.  By
HD#2, his facial edema and hives had resolved, and he was
transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing care.  On the
medical [**Hospital1 **], he was asymptomatic and tolerated regular diet for
lunch well.  After lunch, he was d/c home with instructions to
take benadryl prn for itching or rash.  The pt was instructed to
present to the ED if he developed repeated hives, dyspnea,
weakness, or confusion.
.
2. Chronic pancreatitis:   his pacreatitis has been
long-standing, with evidence of pancreatic calcification on CT
and ERCP consistent with pancreatic ductal stones.  These stones
were not amenable to removal by ERCP, and as they are
contributing to inflammation and pain, the pt was referred for
consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for surgical treatment.  During
his admission, he was treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement
before meals.  His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid
initially, and on the day of d/c the pt was transition to his
usual regimen of oral morphine, with good results.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for surgical consultation after d/c.
