IMAGING
CXR ([**2124-3-15**]):
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There
are low lung
volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Fullness of
the hila and
mild perihilar opacities may relate to mild fluid overload
and/or crowding of vessels. No definite focal consolidation is
seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and
mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with possible mild fluid overload.
Consider
repeat with better inspiration when patient able.
.
EKG
[**2124-3-15**]: HR 120, atrial tachycardia, Nl axis, normal interval,
nl R wave progression, no ST-changes.
[**2124-3-19**]: NSR 84
.
Microbiology:
[**2-/2041**] Blood culture (FINAL): NO growth
MRSA screen: NO MRSA isolated
.
[**3-17**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis
and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with
the exception of the basal posterior and lateral walls, which
are relatively preserved. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded with certainty. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2123-10-7**], there has been marked further
deterioration of left ventricular contractile function as well
as marked increased in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
.
[**3-19**] R FEMORAL ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS: Focused vascular ultrasound of the right groin, the
common femoral artery and vein was performed with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale,
color Doppler, and spectral analysis. Findings are concerning
for an AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and
vein, just proximal to the greater saphenous vein takeoff, where
there is turbulent, mixed broad waveform and suggestion of
connection between the two vessels. No evidence of
pseudoaneurysm is seen. No evidence of hematoma is seen in the
right groin.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for AV fistula between the right
common
femoral artery and vein. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.


Brief Hospital Course:
69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial
tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for
management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to
pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**];
during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which
was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes
thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF.
.
# ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA
Admitted from HD w/atrial tachycardia, a chronic intermittent
issues. Usually asymptomatic; now symptomatic w/lightheadedness
at HD. Admission EKG here documented atrial tachycardia to the
130s, no ischemic changes. Hemodynamically stable and
asymptomatic despite HR intermittently to the 130s. Underwent
successful ablation here on [**2124-3-16**], after which she was in NSR
for >24h. However, she did flip into atrial tachycardia
intermittently thereafter, with HR max 120s - episodes
self-resolved, occurred primarily during HD, and were
asymptomatic. Attempts to increase beta-blockade beyond Toprol
75mg PO QD were limited by BP. Patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
(electrophysiologist) in outpatient follow-up in ~1 week to
discuss any possible future intervenion. In the interim, at home
and at HD, her inpatient cardiologist felt comfortable
tolerating asymptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 120s-130s.
We note that on [**3-16**], post-procedure recovery was initially
complicated by anaesthesia-induced hypotension (requiring
overnight ICU obs) and later by the slow development of a R
femoral AVF (documented by ultrasound, see results). For the R
femoral AVF, vascular surgery consult service evaluated her
daily and recommended conservative management vascular surgery
f/u in 4 weeks. Expect spontaneous resolution.
.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 20%
TTE during this admission demonstrated LVEF 20%, MR 4+ TR 4+,
all worse than prior. MR [**First Name (Titles) 9413**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on exam. Ischemic vs.
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suspected as underlying
cause. She was euvolemic during admission; volume/BP control
primarily via BB and dialysis. Imdur was stopped due to relative
hypotension (SBP 90s-110s). Metoprolol dose increased to Toprol
75 mg QD. We note hx lisinopril allergy; considered started [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] but deferred this for outpatient f/u in setting of
borderline BPs.
.
# ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION
Patient's BP fell to 75/palp when working w/PT on [**3-20**]. Family
confirmed that she suffers from lightheadedness when she first
rises to stand, especially after watching television (she like
Westerns). Imdur had already been stopped prior to this PT eval;
BB was subsequently lowered from Toprol 100 QD to 75 QD (further
decrease thought inappropriate given need to control atrial
tachycardia). She worked with PT twice more and was instructed
on techniques to decrease orthostatic symptoms and prevent
falls. Outpatient PT arranged at discharge.
.
# DM2
Patient has known DM2, not on either oral hypoglycemics or
insulin. Insulin needs here ranged from 8-12U/day. Discussed
initiating insulin w/pt, but she refused. [**Month (only) 116**] require ongoing BS
evaluation/discussion of therapeutic options as an outpatient.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
.
# CAD
Patient w/ significant 2V CAD (LAD stented w/BMS x2, RCA
occluded 100% on [**9-/2123**] cath). EKGs negative for evidence of
restenosis or ischemic changes. No chest pain or dyspnea.
Continued Plavix and ASA 81mg.
.
# CHRONIC ANEMIA
Chronic; family confirms that she receives Epo at outpatient HD.
Denies h/o melena or GI bleeding. Hct remained stable ~30.
.
# ESRD:
Longstanding, on qMWF schedule. No difficulty w/LUE AV fistula
access. Atrial tachycardia episodes occurred primarily during HD
sessions, were asymptomatic and self-resolved within minutes.
See above for cardiology plan re: any future asymptomatic ATach
during HD.
.
# Hx Hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy
TSH wnl at admission. Continued home dose of synthroid.
.
# Hx HLD
Continued home statin.
.
# Hx Seizure disorder
One seizure in the past per patient. Continued home Keppra. No
seizure activity observed.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. EP to reassess for possible future repeat ablation attempt
2. DM2 - Pt refused discussion of insulin, had 8-12U/day insulin
requirement. [**Month (only) 116**] need further discussion/education about risks
of continuing with dietary control and without any medical
management.
3. Worsening sCHF (35%->20%). Suspected declining LVEF due to
tachycardia-induced crdiomyopathy [**2-17**] long-standing Atrial
Tachycardia. Suggest repeat TTE in [**4-21**] mos to reassess LVEF, MR
and TR once rate better controlled.
4. Follow-up HR, BP, orthostatic VS. Toprol dose increased to
75mg po DAILY, imdur stopped.
5. Follow-up logistics of outpatient PT, recommended by
inpatient PT consult
6. Monitor exam for changes in R femoral AVF (vascular surgery
f/u arranged)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you when you were admitted for
rapid heart rate during dialysis similar to the episodes you
have experienced in the past.
.
During this hospital stay, you underwent an ablation procedure.
The procedure was successful - you developed occasional rapid
rates but eventually returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
will see you in follow-up to discuss whether you might need
another ablation procedure if you develop rapid heartrate again.

We noticed that you were lightheaded and had slightly low blood
pressures when you first stand up, especially on dialysis days.
You worked with a physical therapist here who gave
recommendation about standing up slowly to avoid lightheadedness
and falls. We also adjusted your medications to minimize
symptoms.

You had elevated blood sugars here, to >300 on more than 1
occassion. On average, you received 12 units of insulin/day to
control your blood sugar. You did not want to start diabetes
medications. You should discuss this further with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**]
you should be taking medication to control high blood sugar at
home.

The following changes were made to your medications:
CHANGED METOPROLOL FORMULATION:
START TAKING TOPROL XL 75 MG PER DAY (EXTENDED RELEASE). DON'T
TAKE YOUR OLD METOPROLOL/LOPRESSOR PILLS.
STOP TAKING IMDUR

Review your medication list with your PCP and cardiologist at
your next appointment. Please keep your follow-up appointments
as scheduled below.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
