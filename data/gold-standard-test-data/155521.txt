CT (head) [**2105-5-7**]
Since the prior study, slight evolution of the blood products
seen in the pons without change in the mass effect. No
hydrocephalus seen.

TTE: [**2105-5-6**]
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Hyperdynamic left
ventricular systolic function with a mild mid cavitary resting
gradient. No significant valvular abnormality.

CT (head): [**2105-4-28**]
13 x 16 mm left pontine hemorrhage. An MR should be obtained for
further
evaluation to rule out an underlying mass lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 29-year-old man with severe hypertension. He
has undergone work-up by his primary care doctor, a renal
physician and cardiology, without known cause. Hypertension
appears to be familial, present in his father and sister, both
from a young age. It is possible that whatever underlying
predisposition he has is inherited in an autosomally dominant
fashion, although this cannot be concluded given our limited
knowledge of his pedigree. Further outpatient work-up seems
warranted.

There was no underlying vascular malformation or other lesion
from which this hemorrhage has arisen, at least at the
resolution of CT. His compliance has been good but imperfect, so
we think that his hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive during
the exertions of sexual activity. As such, a primary goal has
been to control his blood pressure, which is now quite adequate.


The hemorrhage was in the basis pontis on the left, with
apparent vasogenic edema of the overlying tegmentum. Although
there is not frank hemorrhage into the midline pontine
tegmentum, edema and mass effect in this area most likely
accounts for drowsiness. He initially demonstrated Troemner's
and Babinksi's signs on the left, suggesting some mass effect to
the right basis pontis, but this is now resolved. Eye movement
abnormality is partially explained by lesion of the tract of the
sixth nucleus, with nuclear sparing. In addition, adbuction to
the right is incomplete and the reason for this is only
speculative. He demonstrates loss of voluntary cough and
swallow, with preservation of brisk involuntary cough, likely
due to the effect of the lesion on the dorsal midline portion of
basis pontis, with preserved nucleus ambiguus and lateral
medulla.

Drowsiness resulted in intubation while at the scanner after
arrival at the ED. He was extubated successfully on [**2105-4-28**], with
some difficult managing secretion, but not oxygenation.

When extubated and with controlled pressure he was transferred
to the neurology step-down unit. Atenolol was stopped and
replaced with metoprolol tartrate given better 24 hour coverage
and conversion to the succinate salt is intended at discharge.

After PEG placement he had desaturations to the low 80s and was
sent back to the ICU. His CXR showed low lung volumes and the
etiology was thought to be from the abdominal binder and
restrictive lung disease. He was able to be weaned to trach mask
with low O2 requirements and sent back to the floor. His blood
pressure was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge in the
120s-130s systolic.

He will follow up in clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pontine hemorrhage


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent. - unable to speak
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. - unable to speak
Activity Status: Bedbound.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the neurology service stroke service after
you developed sudden onset of headache and right sided weakness.
On examination you had a flaccid paralysis on your right side
and your eyes were unable to look to the left. You also had
significant bulbar weakness which limited your ability to speak.
Your understanding of language was intact. Your imaging showed a
left sided pontine hemorrhage. The etiology of the bleed was
likely related to longstanding hypertensive which was not always
controlled. You were started on several antihypertensives with a
current goal of being normotensive. You had difficulty
protecting your airway and eating and had a trach and PEG
placed. You are being discharged to rehab with a plan to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
1. Continue antihypertensive regimen at rehab facilty
2. F/U w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in 6 weeks
3. Please follow-up with your PCP after discharge from rehab
