EEG: FINDINGS:
ROUTINE SAMPLING: The background activity was slow reaching a
maximum
of about 6 Hz biposteriorly in the most awake parts of this
recording.
In addition, there was focal slowing in the delta and theta
range seen
in the right central area. There were sharp waves seen
independently in
the right frontal, right central parietal, as well as left
fronto-temporal areas.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed some of the above-mentioned
right and
left sharp waves.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Captured periods of muscle artifact
as well
as blinking artifact but not ongoing seizure activity.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep. The
above-mentioned sharp waves were seen more frequently in sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no ongoing seizure activity.

Interictally, it captured epileptic discharges independently in
the
right frontal, right central parietal, and left fronto-temporal
areas.
The background activity was slow suggestive of diffuse
encephalopathy
with additional focal slowing seen in the right central area
suggestive
of subcortical dysfunction in that region.

CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Chronic left pontine lacunar infarct, new compared to [**Month (only) **]
[**2172**].
3. Posterior dislocation of the right ocular lens, new since [**Month (only) **]
[**2172**].

CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No central, segmental or large subsegmental pulmonary
embolism.
2. Bibasilar consolidations, could reflect atelectasis or
pneumonia.
3. Left thyroid lobe nodule.
4. Coronary artery disease.
5. Indeterminant right hepatic lobe lesion most likely cyst or
hemangioma

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] is a 74 yo M with h/o strokes resultant in minimal
responsiveness, aphagia, frequent aspiration, who presented from
[**Hospital3 **] with tachypnea and question of seizure-like
activity.

# ?Aspiration Pneumonia:
Patient presented with tachypnea, fever, tachycardia, elevated
WBC and was admitted to the MICU. He was started empirically on
Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.  Chest CT-A ruled
out PE, as he was not on any DVT prophylaxis at the nursing
facility.  Chest CT also showed bibasilar atelectasis vs
consolidation. Patient was transitioned to azithromycin and
transferred to floor when hemodynamically stable.  On the floor,
he was restarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of
aspiration pneumonia, re-evaluating bibasilar consolidations on
Chest CT, likely secondary to chronic aspiration from tube
feeds.  Pt was discharged bac kto the facility to continue IV
antibiotics for a total of 7 days.  Pt was without fevers or
leukocytosis at the time of discharge.

# History of Seizures:
Patient was reported to have had seizure-like activity prior to
presentation. Corrected Dilantin level was within therapeutic
range. Pt was continued on seizure ppx, and had no clinically
evident seizure activity. A 48 hr EEG was performed which showed
no seizure activity, only epileptic interictal discharges,
consistent with past stroke.

# Diabetes Mellitus:
Patient was continued on home insulin regimen.

# Hypertension:
Patient was continued on BB, Hydralazine and Lisinopril.

# Anemia: Is normocytic, likely secondary to chronic disease.
Hct was stable, a fecal occult blood was ordered.
.
# Patient was DNR/DNI during this hospitalization.  Pt has a
left PICC for IV access. Pt was maintained on SC Heparin for DVT
ppx. Pt was on tube feeds for nutrition.

Aspiration Pneumonia


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.

Activity Status: Bedbound.


Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] was admitted to the hospital because he was having
difficulty breathing.  He was initially in the ICU, where he was
started on IV antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.  Pt was then
transferred to the medicine floor.  An EEG was performed which
showed no seizure activity.  Pt was then discharged back to the
facility.

He needs immediate medical attention if he experiences
difficulty breathing, has fevers or any other concerning
symptoms.

Please make th following changes to his medications:
START Piperacillin-Tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 8 hours for 5 more
days
START Vancomycin 1000 mg IV every 12 hours for 5 more days

You will need to have your thyroid nodule followed up.

Followup Instructions:
You will be followed by doctors at the facility.  They will
provide you with a follow-up appointment with your primary care
doctor in the future.
