Chief Complaint:
AAA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-27**]:

OPERATION PERFORMED:  Open repair of abdominal aortic
aneurysm and bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with a
Dacron 20 x 10 bifurcated graft as well as a bypass to the
left renal artery.

[**10-29**]:
Operation Performed: Flexible colonoscopy to 60 cm.


History of Present Illness:
 This is a 66-year-old gentleman who
has a known large abdominal aortic aneurysm.  It has now
grown to 8 cm in size.  He has multiple comorbidities;
however, he has been cleared for surgery by cardiology after
cardiac catheterization.  He has a suprarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm which is notamenable to endovascular repair.  he has a
single kidney (left) with a stent in the origin which comes off
the aneurysm and will require bypass.  In addition, he has
bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with a very large (5cm)
right common iliac aneurysm which will require extension of the
graft into the iliac bifurcation.  Given his risk for rupture,
the patient was consented for an open aneurysm repair

showed the size to be 8 cm. His descending thoracic aort is also
enlarged (less than 5 cm), and the right common iliac artery was
aneurysmal (5 cm) with left common iliac smaller (3 cm)
aneurysm. Of note, the
abdominal aortic aneurysm is pararenal and extends to the left
renal artery (which had been stented in [**2165-2-17**]).

RENAL US:

FINDINGS: The right kidney is noted to be atrophic measuring
only 8.0 cm. No vascular flow is identified in the right kidney
and color Doppler imaging.

The left kidney measures 15.2 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. No
cyst or
stone or solid mass is seen in the left kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained from the left kidney only. Note is made that this is a
limited
Doppler study due to the portable technique and the patient's
body habitus.  Arterial flow is documented within the left main
renal artery, but cannot be further assessed. Venous flow is
seen in the main renal vein. Resistive indices are mildly
elevated measuring 80, 79, and 73.

IMPRESSION:
1. Arterial and venous flow identified within the left kidney
with mildly
elevated resistive indices in the intraparenchymal arteries. No
further
assessment can be made at the main renal artery due to the
limited nature of this portable technique and the patient's body
habitus.
2. Atrophic right kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17353**],[**Known firstname **]  was admitted on [**10-27**] with AAA. He agreed to
have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented. A
CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained, all other
preparations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm and bilateral common
iliac artery aneurysms with a Dacron 20 x 10 bifurcated graft as
well as a bypass to the left renal artery.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

He was transferred to the CVICU for further care. He had a
prolong intubation. [**2167-10-27**] - [**2167-11-5**]. He received mo niter
care and pressure support.

During this time frame pt had ATN. His nephrotoxic drugs were
held. He received PRBC for hypotension and volume support. His
baseline creatinine was 1.6, High 4.6, now 2.1. All his home
meds were restarted. He always maintained good urine output.

Pr also had Bowel movements in the immediate post operative
period. transplant was called. Had mucosal sloughing. His
lactate was normal. This is assumed resolved.

Pt had hypernatremia to 147. This resolved with fluids.

After he was extubated he was then transferred to the VICU for
further recovery. While in the VICU he received monitored care.
When stable he was delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult
was obtained. When he was stabilized from the acute setting of
post operative care, he was transferred to floor status

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.

To note his staples were removed on DC. Steri strips are in
place.

PT HAS RUL OPACITY ON CXR. HE NEEDS TO HAVE THIS WORKED UP. HE
NEEDS A CT SCAN OF CHEST. THIS SHOULD BE DONE BY HIS PCP.
