[**2175-8-8**] ERCP FINDINGS: The common bile duct was adequately
opacified with contrast medium after the cannulation of the
biliary duct. No apparent extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary
duct dilatation or irregularity is seen. No filling defects
consistent with stones were noted. As per report, in subsequent
images, biliary stent was successfully placed. IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of biliary stent.

[**2175-8-9**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

[**2175-8-14**] ERCP FINDINGS: Comparison is made with CT from [**8-12**], [**2174**] and prior ERCP from [**2175-8-8**].  There is
removal of a plastic stent. A retrograde cholangiogram shows
multiple filling defects, some of which likely represent stones,
within otherwise normal- appearing biliary tree. A biliary stent
was then placed.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypotension/Sepsis: On admission, patient met SIRS criteria
with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent
with sepsis. Infectious source was likely biliary tract vs. HD
line infection, however also considered was pulmonary source w/
new O2 requirements although more likely from capillary
leak/CHF. Patient has remained fluid responsive intially without
need for pressors. The underlying infection was treated with IV
vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH
grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with
appropriate coverage. The patients lactate level, fevers and WBC
were trended and returned to [**Location 213**]. Zosyn was switched to
Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash.
.
#Mechanical ventilation: Patient came to the ICU intubated s/p
ERCP, on a propofol drip. Initially he was hypotensive which was
treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol, switching to
fentanyl/versed for sedation.  Shortly thereafter the patient
became restless, agitated and continued to be hypotensive. He
was given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial line
placement and foley placement. His labile blood pressures also
exacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state, making it
difficult to wean off the vent. The initiation of hemodialysis
effectively controlled his BP and fluid status, and on day 7,
after his second ERCP, he was extubated and started on CPAP
overnight.
.
# Gallstone Pancreatitis: On admission the patient had elevated
LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin and alk phos. His levels
slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP, which
continued to rise. The patient experienced intermittent
epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US, which showed a
fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised. CT
scan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation,
cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head.
Hepatology and ERCP were consulted prompting a second-look ERCP,
which showed sludge drainage in the major papilla, stent
migrated to major papilla and several stones in the cystic duct.
The stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and the
patient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended.
.
# ESRD: Initially the nephrology service felt HD was not
appropriate early during admission, in setting of patient
becoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation for
pancreatitis. Beta-blockers were started however the patient did
not respond and O2 sats started trending down with worsening
acidemia and low PaO2. The following day HD was initiated with
good response in blood pressure. The patient received HD
throughout his course, with the day before D/c the final time.
.
# Hypoxia: Suspected capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs.
CHF as pt with known CAD. The patient was weaned off his O2
requirement prior to discharge.
.
# Drug Rash: Patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rash
on his chest and legs which was pruritic.  Dermatology was
consulted who felt consistent with a drug rash.  Offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
was felt to be Zosyn.  [**Doctor Last Name **] was discontinued and rash improved.
He will continue hydoxyzine, sarna and fluocinonide.
.
# CAD: An echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a cause
of fever. This showed extensive calcification of cardiac
skeleton, mild calcific aortic stenosis, and no definite
vegetations . His ECG had some ischemic changes of unclear
duration, and the patient had no active symptoms. Cardiac
enzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting of
ESRD, this was unlikely to be acute event. His aspirin and
plavix were continued and the patient remained on telemetry for
the duration of his stay.
.
# OSA: Witnessed apneic episodes while asleep. Known history of
OSA on CPAP as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
Once patient was extubated he was started on CPAP overnight.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Unclear baseline. [**Month (only) 116**] be
low related to ESRD (not on epo as outpatient that we know of).
D. bili not consistent with hemolysis. Hematocrit was trended
and continued to improve with HD and management. Renal recs: use
epo during HD.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen and treated at the hopital for a blockage in the
area of your gallbladder, which caused you to become infected.
You were treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and ERCP
(Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) twice. A small
tube called a stent was placed near your gallbladder so that it
will drain bile into your intestine.

Please take the antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin) until it is
finished. You may also use the skin cream for your rash as long
as you need it. You may take all of your home medications, and
none of the dosages were changed.

Call your doctor or come to the Emergency Department right away
if any of the following problems develop:

* If you are vomitting and cannot keep in fluids or your
medications.

* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomitting,
diarrhea or other reasons.  Signs of dehydration include dry
mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.

* You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a
bowel movement.

* Your skin, or the whites of your eyes become yellow again.

* Your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or not gone
within 24 hours.  Call or return immediately if your pain is
getting worse or is changing location or moving to your chest or
back.

* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 100.4 (F)
degrees or 38(C) degrees.

* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that
concern you.

Followup Instructions:
Please make an appointment to follow up with your PCP:
