History of Present Illness:
HPI:  46 yo M with h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2905**] [**Last Name (un) **] s/p thymectomy on Imuran
who initially presented to his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 151**] T103 and dry cough
treated with Amoxicillin and Augmentin without improvement.  He
was then admitted to an OSH on [**2118-10-25**] for pancytopenia (WBC
2.6, 18% bands, plt 104) and elevated LFTS c/w cholestasis.  He
was treated with Azythromycin and Atovaquone for suspected tick
borne illness.  He had a positive monospot test.  Hepatitis
serologies were negative.
.
Patient was admitted to the surgical service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2118-10-30**] for persisitent fever and an elevated direct Tbili
thought to be secondary to cholangitis.  He was started on
Unasyn.  He underwent an ERCP on [**10-31**] which did not show
biliary tract obstruction, however, a CBD stent was placed.  He
was transfused 1 Unit of PRBC's, 3 bags of FFP, and 3 bags of
plts.
.
Prior to the ERCP he developed repsiratory distress and was
intubated.  CXR revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates.
 He became hemodynamically unstable and he was started on Norepi
gtt.  ID was consulted and Ceftriaxone/ Doxycyclin were added;
Zosyn was d/c'ed.  He spiked a temp to 105.3.  He was transfered
to the MICU on [**10-31**] for further managament.

upgoing, strong DP/PT pulses
Access:  Right IJ triple lumen placed [**11-6**], Left IJ temp
dialysis cath placed [**11-3**] by IR

Pertinent Results:
Liver US [**10-30**]:
1.  Marked gallbladder wall edema with an effaced, non-distended
gallbladder lumen is noted, without intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. There is minimal pericholecystic fluid.
2.  Dilatation of the proximal CBD.
3.  Prominent periportal lymphadenopathy, nonspecific.
.
CxR [**10-31**]: New perihilar pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
ERCP [**10-31**]:
Ccannulation of the common bile duct.  Cholangiogram
demonstrates a normal caliber of the common bile duct and
intrahepatic ducts.  The cystic duct is also filled with
contrast, partially opacifying the gallbladder.  No strictures
or filling defects are identified.  Following cholangiogram,
there is placement of a plastic stent within the common bile
duct.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**10-31**]:
1.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities, which could represent an
infectious process.
2.  Bilateral axillary and right hilar lymphadenopathy, all
could be related to the underlying infectious process.
3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
4.  Although there is ascites, fluid within the lesser sac and
adjacent to the pancreatic head raises the suspicion of
pancreatitis.
5.  Splenomegaly.
6.  Periportal lymphadenopathy.
.
Echo [**11-1**]:  No evidence of endocarditis. Normal global and
regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
Immunophenotyping [**11-2**]:  Pending
.
Bronchial washings [**11-2**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages.  No viral cytopathic changes or
microorganisms seen.
.
R LENI [**11-6**]: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
.
CXR [**11-7**]:  Pulmonary edema, now mild, has improved
substantially since [**11-5**].  A relatively rapid onset
between [**10-30**] and 16 and pace of improvement suggests the
diagnosis is cardiogenic rather than noncardiac edema.  Heart is
normal size.  There is no mediastinal or pulmonary vascular
engorgement.  Lungs are clear aside from bands of atelectasis.
Other pleural surfaces are normal except for mild thickening
associated with fractures of left ribs at least the fifth, which
may have developed between [**11-2**] and 21. Tip of the right
jugular line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic
veins and a left internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**11-7**]:
1. Slightly increased amount of intraabdominal simple free
fluid.
2. Interval placement of CBD stent with collapsed, edematous
gallbladder.
3. Pancreas appears similar to previous exam.
.
CT Head [**11-7**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Interval opacification of multiple mastoid air cells.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
.
# Fever/Pancytopenia/ID/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: Pt
had been afebrile since [**11-4**] and all ABX d/c'ed on [**11-6**],
however, Vanco/Ceftaz were restarted on [**11-7**] for Tm of 102.2.
Concern was for VAP given increased respiratory secretions vs
recurrent pancreatitis with pseudocyst as pancreas enzymes were
rising after recently having restarted TF.  CT Abd/pelvis was
without evidence of worsening radiographic pancreatitis.  Other
sources considered included line infections (Right IJ recently
replaced in same site) or C. diff given prolonged ABX course.
.
Extensive prior infectious workup had revealed a positive EBV
IgM, EBV PCR, and EBV PCR in CSF.  Given pancyotpenia,
splenomegaly, and EBV infection Heme/Onc and ID were considered
the diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, which was
confirmed by repeat bone marrow biopsy (first biopsy
unremarkable).  Pt was begun on etoposode, IVIG and decadron on
~[**11-7**].  His pancytopenia was also treated with epogen and
neupogen.
.
Per HEME, HLH likely triggered by underlying EBV infection.
While there was evidence of EBV in the CSF; because of normal
Protein no need for IT-MTX.  The patient was started on a
steroid taper (currently on 10 mg Decadron) and will need 8
weeks total of Etoposide.  Renal failure, pancreatic
abnormalities, and elevated LFTs all thought to be d/t
underlying HLH.  In addition, ID consults did not recommend
treating EBV viremia with anti-virals.
.
On [**11-9**], pt was noted to have EBSL klebsiella in a sputum and
BAL sample, and was begun on meropenem for 14 day course. He
continued to develop low grade temperature (100.0-100.6), which
were attributed to his HLH, IVIG, and CVVHD.
.
#  Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**2118-10-30**] for impending
respiratory distress at time of his ERCP.  Upon admission to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**], his respiratory mechanics had improved
considerably, and he was oxygenating and ventilating well on PS
5/0.  Initially unable to extubate secondary to altered mental
status and increased secretions.  Pt was often desyncrhonous on
vent secondary to hiccups when sedation weaned.  As mental
status improved gradually, pt was extubated on [**11-10**].   His
respiratory status continued to improve slowly, despite +BAL for
EBSL klebsiella and total body fluid overload, and on [**11-14**] pt
was sat'ing >95% on RA.
.
# Mental Status - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] alert & oriented,
however his mental status subsequently declined.  After
intubation on [**10-30**], pt remained largely sedated until just
prior to admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**].  Attempts to wean
sedation were limited by hiccups which resulted in dysynchrony
the mechanical ventilation, breif neuro exam at time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
admission with sedation weaned revealed pt responsive only to
deep painful stimulus (sternal rub),  pupils minimally reactive
to light bilaterally, gag was present, with slow corneal reflex.
 +hyperreflexia, though tone was flacid, and 5-10 beat clonus of
both feet was noted which initially worsened to 20 beat clonus
on [**11-11**] before slowly improving.
.
Was seen by the neurology/psychiatry services given his new
neurological findings and h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (which
predominantly was ocular per pt's family).  EEG was obtained
which showed diffuse slowing, but no focus of seizure activity.
CT head on [**11-7**] unremarkable. Over the course of his first week
in the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt's mental status improved dramatically,
presumably with chemotherapy.  By [**11-14**] pt was alert, pleasantly
conversive, and following all commands.  His imuran for
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] has been held since admission.  Neuro also
noted proximal weakness of his arms, which improved during his
hospital course.  Per Neruo, he should hold Imuran until he
follows up with Neuro as an outpatient.
.
# Renal - pt without h/o CRI, developed ARF likely secondary to
ATN from hypotension and underlying HLH on [**11-1**].  Pt was
started on CVVHD at that time for volume overload [**2-17**] anuria,
however, UOP gradually improved, and on [**11-15**] pt was
discontinued from HD.  Creatinine normal on discharge.
.
# Cholestasis/hepatitis/pancreatitis - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH with RUQ pain, fever, and elevated LFTs (Tbil 7's), for
which he underwent ERCP with CBD stent on [**11-2**].  LFTs have
since trended down, though amylase/lipase (peak in 1000s) were
starting to plateau at 500s on [**11-14**].  CT abdomen showed
pancreatic fluid collection, but not psuedocyst or necrosis.  On
[**11-13**] pt denied abdominal pain, and was hungry, thus was
transitioned from TPN to TF cautiously, as prior attempt to
restart tube feeds was limited by bump in amylase/lipase.  On
[**11-14**], pt was tolerating TF without difficulty, in addition to
sips of clear liquids, thus he was advanced to a regular diet
after a speech & consult was obtained. On the floor, he
tolerated his diet without other clinical s/sx of pancreatitis.
.
Psych:  thought the patient had a mild encephalopathy that was
slowly resolving.  Recommeded Haldol/Seroquel for sleep;
however, this made the patient feel strage.  Given resolution of
MS changes, ok for patient to receive ambien at rehab prn.
.
HTN: kept on Lopressor 100 mg TID with excellent results.
