HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old man
who was admitted to an outside hospital after pulling his
chronic Foley catheter out at [**Hospital3 24509**] Home.
The patient had a urinary tract infection with probable
urosepsis and he is chronically treated with Foley catheter
as a result of his atonic bladder which was thought to be
related to his systemic amyloidosis which he has been
diagnosed with for some time.  The patient developed
urosepsis, took out his Foley catheter with the balloon
inflated and was taken to an outside hospital for reinsertion
of the Foley catheter and evaluation of hematuria.  The
patient had significant pain with reinsertion of the Foley
catheter and was resisting significantly in the Emergency
Room and was given multiple pain medications, most notably
Versed for sedation and pain control in order to place the
Foley catheter.  Unfortunately the patient became apneic and
went into respiratory failure and was intubated.  The patient
was admitted to [**Hospital6 256**]
intubated and directly transferred to the Fenard Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient was monitored for one night in the
Intensive Care Unit on mechanical ventilation.  He was doing
fine and had no signs of pulmonary function outside of a
possible pneumonia in the left lower lobe.  The patient took
out his own endotracheal tube on the second day of admission
and did very well with no further evidence of respiratory
failure over-sedation from the Versed that he received the
day prior.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Company 191**]
Medicine Service on [**11-29**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiac amyloidosis echocardiogram
from [**2119-11-22**] showing diffusely hypokinetic left
ventricle with ejection fraction of 40%, diffusely
hypokinetic right ventricle, amyloidosis on a lung basis.
Left lower lobectomy, status post limited stage lung cancer.
Cervical and spinal lumbar stenosis, status post multiple
back surgeries and complicated by atonic bladder, peripheral
neuropathy, bilateral ulnar neuropathy, status post carpal
tunnel surgery on the right, depression with question of
bipolar disorder and recurrent urinary tract infections
secondary to chronic Foley catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Shortness of breath - The patient continued
to improve from a respiratory standpoint and required no
oxygen.  After being extubated there were no signs of
congestive heart failure and was maintained on 1.5 liter
fluid restriction q. day and his outpatient Lasix regimen.

Urinary tract infection - Foley catheterization, the patient
tolerated his Foley catheter and was treated with Levaquin
for urinary tract infection and possible left lower lobe
pneumonia, all of this was felt to be atelectasis upon
further review of the chest radiographs.  The patient was to
complete a seven day course of Levaquin, 500 mg q. day.  He
had no urinary symptoms on discharge.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 2716**] Point.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in
condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day
3.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q. day to complete a seven day
course
4.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day
5.  Toprol 100 mg p.o. q. day
6.  Detrol discontinued due to anticholinergic side effects
causing mental status changes
7.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day
8.  Lamictal 200 mg p.o. q.h.s. for bipolar disorder
9.  Depakote 1500 mg p.o. q.h.s. for bipolar disorder
10. Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day for depression

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure secondary to Versed overdose
2.  Systemic amyloidosis
3.  Pulmonary amyloidosis
4.  Cardiac amyloidosis
5.  Atonic bladder
6.  Urinary tract infection
7.  Urosepsis

ADDENDUM - PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile,
