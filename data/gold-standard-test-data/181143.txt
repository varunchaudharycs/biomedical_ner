Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o F with baseline dementia and on coumadin for a-fib is s/p
unwitnessed fall with unknown LOC presents to OSH. She presented
with an INR of 4.3 and was given one dose of vitamin K and a
dilantin load. Head CT showed bilateral frontal IPH and SAH. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup. Upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 **], patient was given 2 units of FFP and profiline in
the ED for an INR of 5. She was admitted to the ICU for
neurosurgical observation.  Her exam was nonverbal and confused,
but full strength. She was cleared by the trauma service of
further injuries. On [**9-25**], patient's exam much improved, she is
alert to self and full strength. Repeat head CT stable and
patient's INR was 1.3. While in the ICU she went in to rapid
afib with heart rate in the 140's and she was started on a
diltiazem iv drip with plan to wean to PO diltiazem.

On [**9-26**] pt had a repeat CT head that showed no change from her
previous scan. Her INR remained below 1.3. She remained in the
ICU to continue her diltiazem IV drip for treatment of her
atrial fibrilation. Cardiology was consulted for further
management and felt it was safe to discontinue her IV and PO
diltiazem and remain on her amiodarone PO. Her lopressor was
increased per their recommendations to 50mg twice daily. Her
heart rate remained stable and had no further episodes of rapid
atrial fibrilation.

[**Date range (1) 80149**] Pt transfered to the floor in stable condition. Repeat
head ct showed no change in size of contusions and was stable
when compared to previous exams. Her blood pressure was noted to
be in the 170s, and cardiology recommended adding HCTZ to her
current regimen. She was seen by physical therapy and plan was
for discharge to her extended care facility. The patient's
neurologic examination remained unchanged throughout the entire
hospitalization.
