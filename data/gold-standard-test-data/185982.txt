she had a virus. The patient refused to eat and seemed confused

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 43 yo woman with left MCA aneurysm rupture.
.
Hospital course:
.
Patient was admitted from ED to Neuro ICU for q1 hour neuro
checks.  She had CTA/MRA/MRI which showed evolving L IPH of L
basal ganglia and frontal lobe with IVH and evidence of
obstructive hydrocephalus.  She had a L MCA coiling performed
and an external ventricular drain placed on [**12-11**]. Started on
cefazolin as prophylaxis for the drain. She remained intubated
until POD 3. She spiked a temperature on POD3. Pan cultures and
CSF sent.  CSF was concerning for infection with 250 WBCs.
Started on empiric Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.  Infectious
disease was consulted and recommended cipro and c.diff checks.
Continued to spike temps over her hospitalization and multiple
blood, csf, and urine cx have been negative except for two urine
cx's that grew GPR and Lactobacillus.  UTI's treated
appropriately but continued to spike fevers. MRI was not
concerning for infection. Eventually it was decided to hold abx
for a presumed drug fever.  After stopping antibiotics patient
remained afebrile.  She had hyponatremia and leukopenia on labs.
 Patient was fluid restricted and started on salt tabs.
Patient's hct then steadily declined no source defined - guaiac
negative.  Her neuro exam markedly improved and was doing very
well with physical therapy. Patient was transferred to medicine
service for workup of anemia and treatment of metabolic issues.
.
On the medicine service:
.
# Leukopenia:  The patient had a leukopenia on transfer. An ANC
was checked when the WBC dropped to 1.8, with an ANC of 700.
Etiology of leukopenia was likely lab error versus medication
effect (Keppra, vancomycin).  She will have her WBC monitored as
an outpatient.
.
# Anemia: On the day of transfer from neurosurgery, she was
noted to have a 10-point hct drop from 30 to 20.  This drop was
from lab error, as the repeat check was 26%.  Hemolysis labs
were negative and reticulocytes were normal with an retic index
of 1.8. There was no sign of bleeding and she was guaiac
negative.
.
# Aneurysm rupture: Was stable on transfer. Coil stable without
new pathology seen on MRI/MRA [**12-24**]. Patient's memory and weakness
deficits were improving daily per boyfriend's report. The
nimodipine was discontinued on [**1-2**] and the keppra was continued
(will be on this until 1 month follow-up with neurosurgery.  She
was discharged on Plavix 75 mg po qday and aspirin for coil per
neurosurgery directions.  She was asked to arrange a follow-up
MRI/MRA in one month and then see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] after that.
.
# Right-hand weakness/Cognitive deficits: Improving per patient
and boyfriend. Only minimal weakness noted on exam with wrist
extensors, all other strength was equal bilaterally. Patient is
right handed and was still having significant difficulty writing
at the time of discharge. Per OT notes, the patient's RUE
function was improving and recommended outpatient rehab as soon
as appropriate. Concerning the cognitive function, she was not
at baseline at the time of discharge. She had improved during
her hospitalization but experienced delayed responses and
speech. She was discharged with plans for outpatient OT, PT and
speech therapy.
.
# Anorexia: Patient reported having no appetite since the
aneurysm bleed, but eating because she knows she needs to eat.
Likely related to the aneurysm rupture, and should improve with
time. Considered an appetite stimulant and suggested starting as
an outpatient is appetite did not improve. Did not appear to be
secondary to depression. She was encouraged to take in high
calorie, smaller meals supplemented with ensure. Weight was
stable.
.
# DVT: Right calf vein DVT at the level of the peroneal vein
seen on doppler on [**12-24**]. On transfer to medicine was on ASA,
plavix, and SQ heparin.  Neurosurgery requested that she not be
started on coumadin for now, but aggreed to theraputic lovenox
for a course of [**1-22**] months. She will continue lovenox until her
neurosurgery follow-up visit and the issue of coumadin
transition can be discussed at that time.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a ruptured brain anurysm.
The aneurysm was coiled and the bleeding was stopped. You
developed post-op fever and were treated with antibiotics for
suspected infection. These antibiotics were stopped when you
developed a rash. The rash was likely due to ceftriaxone or
ceftazidime, both of which are part of a group of medications
called cephalosporins. You should not take cephalosporins for
infection in the future. Your cognitive deficits have improved
since the aneurysm bleeding was stopped and your right arm/hand
weakness is improving.

You were started on an antiseizure medication (Keppra) due to
the bleed and will need to take this until directed to stop by
your neurosurgeon. For the coil, you were also started on
aspirin and plavix. You will continue to the aspirin
indefinetely. You will take the plavix for one more week and
then can stop this medication. It was discovered that you
developed a DVT in your right leg. You were started on a blood
thinning medication (lovenox) and will need to take this until
directed to stop.
