Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1032**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation
Radial arterial line insertion

History of Present Illness:
58y/o RHM with history of liver transplant, Hepatitis C, chronic
renal disease and multiple asymptomatic strokes, presented with
sudden decline in his mental status. His wife witnessed him be
struggling get out from bed, decline in his
awareness. His wife spoke to him with appropriate condition
around 6:05PM. Around 6:25PM, she heard that the patient started
to say non-sence, act inappropriately, unable to exchange
conversation. His wife recalled some "shaking" at the right arm.
He was brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED above time and Neurology was
consulted for code stroke.

In ED, while Neurology was examining patient, he developed right
arm, leg clonic seizure with head deviation and gaze deviation
toward to left. He responded with moan when his name was called,
then developed left arm clonic seizure (secondary
generalization) and became unresponsive. Ativan 2mg IV was given
to stop. Patient was intubated subsequently to have further
neuroradiological evaluation.

HPI ADDENDUM:
Further history was obtained from the patient's wife the morning
following his admission. She reports the patient was well until
returning from a same-day-surgical procedure on [**10-14**] for repair
of left eye retinal detachment. The patient was vague with his
reported symptoms, but complained of "feeling lousy" with poor
appetite and fatigue. He did not eat or drink very much Friday
or Saturday following. On Saturday evening he began to vomit
quite frequently. They had a small breakfast Sunday morning and
the patient was still feeling unwell, but altogether normal per
his wife. She left for a few hours during the day, returned home
and heard him yelling out of frustration after having dropped
something in his room, however the yelling continued and she
went to see him and noted that he had a great amount of
difficulty getting himself upright to the edge of his bed. She
then noted his right arm was shaking. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where the above described event occurred.


Past Medical History:
- ETOH/HCV cirrhosis s/p Liver Transplant [**2195**] on
immunosuppression.  Course c/b recurrent hep C viremia, CRI, LFT

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] is a 58 year old gentleman s/p liver transplant
related to chronic HCV infection, myopathy (? steroid induced),
history of prior multiple asymptomatic embolic infarcts prior to
transplantation, who presents with three day prodrome of general
malaise, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, followed by acute
change in mental status with witnessed partial complex seizure
in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

1) Neuro:
* SEIZURE - Initially a code stroke was called in the ED, but CT
imaging and later, MRI, showed no evidence of acute infarction.
Initial labs notable for presence of only serum benzodiazepines
on tox screening and acute on chronic renal failure. Etiology of
seizure was thought to be areas of prior cortical infarcts in
setting of gastrointestinal illness. The patient was intubated
in the emergency department and promptly extubated at 2am in the
Neuro ICU the same evening. The morning following admission the
patient's examination was notable for marked encephalopathy. He
was changed from phenytoin to oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) given
multiple long term side effects of phenytoin, and with normal
hepatic function, but renal impairment and keppra did not seem a
wise choice. Lumbar puncture was attempted with light sedation
without success. It was re-attempted with fentanyl and midazolam
for monitored conscious sedation and revealed 1 WBC, 0 RBC,
normal protein and glucose. He was transferred to the floor
after an EEG done on the [**7-18**] revealed no
abnormalities and showed a normal background.
* ENCEPHALOPATHY - On the floor, the patient's exam was notable
for continued encephalopathy, but he was evidently not
delerious. His main abnormalities were frontal dysfunction (as
exhibited by impulsiveness, stimulus-bound behaviors,
desinhibition, bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes, a
marked inability to switch mindset) and memory (as exhibited by
anososgnosia, orientation to place and time, as well as not
imprinting new information, and working memory (the patient
stayed in-task, and had sufficent attention to perform, but
couldn't complete the tasks). Clinically he continued to improve
slowly but surely, an EEG done on [**10-21**] showed 7 Hz background,
but otherwise normal. Per his wife, his level of cognitive
functioning at home was high, as for example he was able to
discuss politics.

2) Cardio:
* NSTEMI - Patient was noted to have elevated troponin enzymes
to 0.31 with EKG without ischemic changes. He was started on
aspirin, beta blocker, atorvastatin. Cardiology consultation was
obtained and additionally recommended echocardiogram which
revealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, no
focal wall motion abnormalities (poor data quality though),
LVEF>55%, mild aortic valve stenosis. His NSTEMI was thought
related to demand related ischemia in the setting of
catecholamine surge associated with seizure. He should be
scheduled for an exercise stress test as an outpatient.

3) FEN
* Acute Renal Failure - Patient's has prior hepato-renal
syndrome now with baseline creatinine of 1.9-2. Admission
creatinine notable for 2.4. He was noted to have low urine
output. He received vigorous IV hydration with improved Cr to
1.6, however this was likely a sampling error because all the
lines of his cellcount were down on this blooddraw as well,
repeat labs showed a creat of 2.0 and his [**Hospital1 **] back to the old
values. His medications were renally dosed. He was started on
Thiamine, Folate and MVI.

4) Liver transplantation
Transaminase levels on admission were WNL. Hepatology
consultation was obtained and recommended continuing with his
prior regimen of immunosuppressive agents. No changes were made.


5) ID
A broad spectrum of CSF studies were sent despite the normal
cell count. Varicella PCR and CMV PCR negative, remainder
pending. MRSA isolation negative. VRE swab negative.
Cryptococcal antigen GRAM STAIN, FLUID CULTURE, FUNGAL
CULTURE-PRELIMINARY,ACID FAST CULTURE, VIRAL CULTURE were all
(preliminary) negative.

6) PPx, reactivation and reconditioning
For prophylaxis, he was put on Heparin, pneumoboots, TEDs, and
PT and OT were consulted to evaluate and treat him.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Complex partial seizure with secondary generalization.

Discharge Condition:
Stable, improving cognitively.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been admitted with an epileptic seizure, most likely
related to small scars in your brain from old small strokes,
possibly in the setting mild dehydration. After this you have
been confused for a while, which is not unusual with a fragile
brain, a post-seizure state and a lot of medications on board.
Your medications such as Remeron and Methylphenidate have been
temporarily discontinued - please follow up with your doctor to
perhaps reverse these changes when you are back to your
baseline.

Please take all medications as directed, and attend all your
follow-up appointments. If you experience any signs or symptoms
of concern, please contact your doctor immediately, or in case
of urgency go directly to the emergency room - for example in
case of recurrence of seizures.
