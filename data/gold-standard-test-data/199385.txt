Chief Complaint:
small bowel obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Parastomal hernia repair and take down of colostomy with

History of Present Illness:
This patient had undergone a series of bouts of intestinal
obstruction.  This last time she was in fact given an upper GI
series and small bowel follow through and when she came to the
hospital, she had some barium and a nest of bowel in the pelvis.
It was not clear exactly what the cause of obstruction was but
she did not pass much gas nor was she able to get rid of her
nasogastric tube. The colostomy was prolapsed and it appeared on
CT scan that she had an area of a kink in the small bowel which
was a transitional point. This in fact was the case but it was
also a place where she was obstructed with barium.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for the question of small bowel
obstruction.  On CT scan she had an area of twisted bowel along
with her large parastomal hernia.  Her ostomy output had no
stool or gas in it.  She was taken to the OR to resolve these
issues.  In the OR she had a large amount of barium in the small
intestine which was moved into the cecum.  She had a
hyperkalemia directly following surgery which resolved with an
insulin drip.  She was admitted to the ICU for this purpose.
Her blood sugars were difficult to control post-operatively and
she was maintained on the insulin drip for the first 3 days
post-operatively.  It was also difficult to ween her from her O2
needs post-op (this was most likely due to her very long smoking
history).  Eventually she was restarted on her home metformin
and was able to come off of oxygen therapy.  On day 3
post-operatively gas and stool appeared at her ostomy following
a bowel regimen of colace and mineral oil.  She was discharged
home to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in clinic.  She was
tolerating PO intake at discharge and was in good condition.
