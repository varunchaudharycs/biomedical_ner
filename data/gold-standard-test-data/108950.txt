History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10220**] is a 69 yo F with breast cancer with mets to
peritoneum on complicated by acites requiring 14 paracenteci
since [**9-2**], on navelbine/avastin C2D13 now presents wtih dyspnea
and poor po intake. Patient noticed increased DOE over the last
36 hours with increased labored breathing while walking around
the house and requiring assistance to even walk around the
living room. Patient also reports increased nausea with
vomitting 7-10 times over the last 2 days. Vomitius is
nonbilious, and patient has been unable to tolerate po intake.
Patient often has diarrhea related to Chemo, but reportedly no
diarrhea since Tuesday. Patient was seen by VNA today and BP was
60/p. EMS was called and on arrival BP was 80/p.
.
In the ED, patient was noted to be hypotensive on arrival but
improved with 3 L NS. Inital resident echo was concerning for
pericardial effusion with collapse of RV, but formal TTE by
Cardiology fellow showed no evidence of tamponade. LENIS were
negative for DVT. CT head was negative. CXR was unremarkable.
Vanco/Zosyn was given for initial concern of sepsis. Lytes were
noteable for Na 117 down from 122 earlier in the month and Cr
2.2 from 0.8. Also noted to be neutropenic. Patient refused
central line and code status was reportedly DNR/I.
.
On the floor, patient reports chronic low back pain, and feels
weak and fatigued, but otherwise feels well.
.

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
Breast cancer
- Diagnosed in [**2174**] with an infiltrating lobular carcinoma grade

II, 1.7 cm, multifocal, with 13 out of 29 lymph nodes positive.
The tumor was ER positive, PR positive, and HER-2/neu negative
by both IHC and FISH. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy after
completion of surgery with Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 10

weekly doses of Taxol. She received and completed chest wall
radiation. She was then started on adjuvant Arimidex therapy. In

[**2178-1-25**] she developed right shoulder pain and pain in her
upper abdomen. The abdominal pain prompted workup and apparently

blood work showed a CA [**95**]-29 level of 203. A PET scan revealed
nodularity in her omentum consistent with metastatic disease. A
bone scan reportedly was negative. She was started on high-dose
Faslodex hormone treatment [**2178-3-12**] and progressed on this

in [**2178-7-25**]. She was started on Xeloda in [**8-/2178**] and
continued and recently progressed with her last dose of Xeloda
on [**2178-12-5**].
- S/p Fulvestrant x7 last given [**2178-9-16**]
- Temodar PARP Phase II Trial: Cycle #: 1 Day 1: [**2179-1-13**], went
off trial for for toxicity
- VinORELbine (Navelbine) 40 mg IV day 1 ([**2179-1-21**]), held day 8
and 15 due to neutropenia. (30 mg/m2 - dose reduced by 17% to 25

mg/m2)

[**3-8**] Echo:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal image quality and focused views, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be excluded.. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a very small
pericardial effusion, primarily around the right atrium and
basal right ventricle with no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
[**3-8**] CXR:
(pending final read)
.
[**3-8**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of either lower extremity.
.
[**3-8**] Head CT:
IMPRESSIONS: No acute intracranial abnormality. No evidence of
intracranial mass, but MRI is more sensitive for the detection
of intracranial lesions and should be considered.

[**3-10**]: KUB
Moderate amount of ascites with largest pocket seen within the
right lower quadrant. Multiple septations are noted compatible
with component
of loculation of the fluid.

[**3-12**]: Request for Pleurx catheterization for palliative
peritoneal ascites drainage.
1. Successful placement of Pleurx catheter in the right abdomen,
with the tip
terminating in the lower pelvis.
2. Removal of one liter of yellow ascites fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient expired.

69 yo F with metastatic breast cancer prsents with vomitting,
poor po intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure with
hyponatremia.  Was tachycardic and complaining of mild chest
tightness.  Admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and
hyponatremia, then to the oncology floor.  See below for
discussion of each issue.
.
Goals of care: meeting in ICU regarding goals of care and poor
prognosis, then reiterated on the oncology medicine floor:
Code: DNR/I (discussed with patient and HCP), and daughter HCP
[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80568**]. Focus on comfort with symptom management.
Avoidance of invasive procedures, per family (son, daughter,
sister).
[**Name2 (NI) **] died the morning after being transferred to the ICU.
.
# Altered mental status: Patient does not respond to verbal or
visual stimuli on the floor. Likely d/t progressive metastatic
disease, combined with renal failure, hypotension, pain, SBP
infection, delirium. Pain controlled with IV morphine prn,
treated SBP with ceftriaxone, palliative care following.
.
# Chest Pain: unclear etiology, seemed to be costrochondritis
related as the pain was reproducible. Ruled out for MI with
three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  A V/Q of her chest was
ordered to rule out PE, but the patient was unable to lie flat
and complete the exam so it was aborted. Held anticoagulation
d/t goals of care, no CTA given ARF, could not tolerate V/Q
scan. On the floor, patient unable to verbalize whether chest
pain still present. Pain medications provided.
.
# Hypotenion/Tachycardia: likely was related to underlying
cancer and hypovolemia.  Was volume resuccitated with NS and the
LR while in the ICU for the first two days.  She was offerred a
CVL in the ED and declined.  Her BP improved to SBPs in the 90s,
then 100s with IVFs and remained stable.  Initially she seemed
fluid responsive with a decrease in rate from 130s to 110s
(which seemed to be her baseline).  She remained tachycardic on
day two of admission without an obvious cause as she seemed
mostly fluid repleted.  We continued to bolus her and pursued a
further workup for PE.  Initially she had negative LENIs and a
CT was deferred because of ARF.  A V/Q scan was performed on
[**2179-3-10**], but she was unable to lie flat for the test and the
test could not be completed.  She was bolused periodically
overnight to maintain MAP of over 65.  Her tachycardia improved
with IVF boluses prn.
.
# Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history,
likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Most likely Gi losses combined
with third spacing in the setting of ascites. With fluid
resuccitation, she corrected and normalized very quickly but did
not have any neurological changes.  She did have a CT head in
the ED that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.  Her
ARF also improved with IVFs and her urine output remained brisk
throughout her hospitalization.
.
# Thrush: Likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting.
Started swish and swallow for her comfort.
.
# Breast Cancer: mid-cycle in her avastin and navelbine.  Is
metastatic and has recurrent ascites requiring taps.  On
presentation, her abdomen was soft and a therapeutic
paracentesis was deferred because of her hypovolemia, moderate
hypotension and neutropenia.  Oncology was consulted and
followed along.  Patient to oncology floor, outpatient oncology
attending described poor prognosis. Family meeting regarding
poor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have further
chemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures.
.
# Leukopenia: Likely chemo related, as last dose was [**3-1**]. ANC
600 so not yet neutropenic and never needed to be on neutropenic
precautions. On 3 18, her WBC began to recover.
.
# Pleurex catheter placed to help with paracentesis/ascites
drainage. SBP treated with ceftriaxone.
