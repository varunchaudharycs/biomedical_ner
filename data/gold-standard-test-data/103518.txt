NO acute fx or malalignment.


Final Report
INDICATION: 86-year-old female status post fall with acute
mental status
changes.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the C-spine without IV contrast.

COMPARISON: MR of the C-spine available from [**2191-6-5**].

FINDINGS: There are no acute fractures or traumatic
malalignment. There is
mild straightening of lordosis, consistent with the presence of
cervical
collar. There are moderate to severe degenerative changes
throughout the
cervical spine, including severe facet arthropathy, and loss of
intervertebral disc space, most severely at C5 through T1. There
is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 over C5. Diffuse disc bulging
is present at C5-C6 and C6-C7, resulting in moderate spinal
canal stenosis, most severely at C5-C6.

There is no prevertebral hematoma or adjacent soft tissue
abnormalities.
Included views of the lungs demonstrate mild dependent
atelectasis
bilaterally. There are multiple nodules within the slightly
enlarged right
thyroid lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fractures or traumatic malalignment.
2. Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes throughout the
cervical spine,
most severely at C5-C6, with associated moderate spinal canal
stenosis.
3. Multiple right thyroid nodules.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Wet Read: LLTc MON [**2196-11-14**] 10:44 AM
Left subdural hematoma with mixed hyperdensity, concerning for
active bleed, tracking along the left convexivity and left
tentorium.

Rightward shift of midline structures up to 17 mm, with
significant
effacement of the left lateral ventricle. Dilated temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of right
lateral ventricle concerning for early hydrocephalus.

Rightward subfaclcine herniation. Early righward uncal
herniation.


Final Report
INDICATION: 86-year-old female status post fall and acute mental
status
changes.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.

COMPARISON: CT of the head available from [**2193-12-12**].

FINDINGS:
There is a large left cerebral subdural hematoma, measuring up
to 17 mm in
thickness, with blood tracking along the left tentorium. There
is significant neighboring mass effect on left cerebral sulci
and the left lateral ventricle with subfalcine herniation and
17-mm rightward shift of normally midline structures. The
hematoma has mixed hyper and hypoattenuating components,
consistent with an acute on chronic bleeding. There is slight
effacement of the suprasellar cistern, concerning for an early
rightward uncal herniation. Slight hyperattenuation along the
suprasellar cistern borders may represent trace subarachnoid
blood. The quadrigeminal cistern is preserved but slightly
asymmetric. The right lateral ventricle is slightly effaced, and
the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is slightly dilated in comparison to the prior
CT exam from [**2193-12-12**], concerning for possible early
hydrocephalus.

Again, there is significant hypoattenuation of the
periventricular white
matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.

There are no acute fractures. There is a large subgaleal
hematoma overlying the left parietal and occipital regions, with
a more focal hyperattenuating region representing a more focal
hematoma. The middle ear cavities and included portions of the
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.  The orbits
are symmetrical and intact.

IMPRESSION: Large acute left subdural hematoma with associated
mass effect, subfalcine herniation and left uncal herniation.

Findings were communicated with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 10:45 a.m.
on [**2196-11-14**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report
INDICATION: 86-year-old woman with subdural hematoma on
Coumadin, status post
evacuation. Evaluate for interval change.

COMPARISON: Multiple head CTs most recent of [**2196-11-14**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and axial fat-saturated T2, FLAIR,
gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images were obtained of
the head.

FINDINGS: Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are noted,
consistent with acute infarcts in the left anterior, middle, and
posterior cerebral artery vascular territories. In addition,
areas of acute infarct are noted in the right anterior and
posterior cerebral artery vascular territories, involving the
right thalamus. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation of these infarcts. There is persistent rightward
shift of midline structures which has improved since the
previous study, now measuring approximately 6 mm down from 10
mm. Previously noted pneumocephalus is resolving. Residual left
subdural hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage are again
seen, unchanged. The ventricles remain unchanged in size. The
major vascular flow voids appear
patent.

IMPRESSION:
Acute multi vascular territorial infarcts most pronounced in the
left
hemisphere, as described above. While these can relate to
compression of the arteries from the extensive SDH and mass
effect, embolic etiology is also in the differential diagnosis.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] shortly after
review on [**2196-11-15**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.





Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 97533**] arrived to the ED intubated for airway protection.
She recieved Profiline 9 and several units of FFp to reverse her
coagulopathy and went emergently for a left sided craniotomy for
SDH evacuation. Post operatively she was left intubated and
transferred to the Surgical intensive care unit.

Her exam never improved.  She was followed clinically for the
next few days.  An MRI was performed for prognostics.  She was
made CMO after a family meeting.  She later expired.
