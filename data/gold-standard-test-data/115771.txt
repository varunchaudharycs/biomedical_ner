Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1646**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for alcoholic pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
NGT placement post pyloric by floroscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12130**] is a 44 year old man with ETOH abuse and Crohns'
disease initially admitted to OSH [**12-23**] with abdominal pain
radiating to back, nausea and vomiting x 1 week, which became
progressively worse over 24 hours PTA found to have acute
pancreatitis with initial amylase>3000 and CT with evidence of
necrotizing pancreatitis. At OSH, he was treated with bowel
rest, IVF and started on primaxin. Course was complicated by
ETOH withdrawal and DTs so he was transferred to ICU there and
started on an ativan drip which was uptitrated to 15mg/hr. He is
being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management, ? need for
surgical intervention. Course also c/b fevers to 101 and
positive blood cx with GPCs in clusters on [**2129-12-28**] (2 bottles of
coag neg staph, sensitive to cefazolin, CTX, cipro/levo, clinda,
azithro, oxacillin, bactrim, tetra, and vanc). He reportedly had
been started on TPN day prior to transfer via PICC.
.
VS prior to transfer: T:101 rectal HR: 110s BP:120-130/70-80
RR:30s O2 sat: 99-100%2L
.
Upon arrival to the ICU a complete ROS could not be obtained.
Prior to transfer to the medical floor the patient was able to
state that he did not have CP, SOB, dysuria, headache,
neurologic changes, visual changes prior to presentation. He had
pain in his abdomen with defecation which is consistent with his
Crohn's disease.
.
Per discussion with family, patient had denied any other
complaints prior to admission other than right shoulder pain
which was attributed to rotator cuff tear and was recently being
worked up with MRI. He had approximately 1 episode of emesis per
week for 3 weeks PTA and had multiple episodes nonbloody bilious
emesis on day of admission with epigastric abdominal pain as
above. Had denied fevers, chills, diarrhea, joint pains,
headache or any other complaints. Denies recent weight loss or
gain.
.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a rectal tube placed for frequent stooling.
Two cidffs have been negative. A post pyloric feeding tube
placed and he started tube feeds. His PICCL was d/c'ed and
cultured. On [**2129-12-31**] he developed thrush and was started on
nystatin. While in the ICU his mental status slowly cleared.
.
ROS:
Currently reports [**12-28**] pain in his R shoulder c/w rotator cuff
tear. He does not have any abdominal pain. No cp/sob/n/v. +

REPORTS:

CXR [**2129-12-29**]:
Lung volumes are extremely low exaggerating vascular congestion
in the lungs and mediastinum though there may be volume
overload. Discrete opacification at the left lung base is
probably atelectasis. Pleural effusions are small if any.
Cardiac silhouette is largely obscured by the high diaphragm but
not grossly dilated. No pneumothorax. Left PIC catheter passes
at least as far as the upper right atrium, obscured beyond that
by overlying EKG leads.

CXR [**2130-1-1**]:
FINDINGS: Radiodense tip of feeding tube is visualized in the
upper to mid
cervical region as communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Exam is
otherwise similar to recent radiograph of two days earlier.

CT head [**2130-1-1**]:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major
vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent, likely reflective of atrophy. Minimal mucosal
thickening of the ethmoid air cells are noted bilaterally.
Osseous structures reveal no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR PA/LAT [**2130-1-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent opacity favoring
atelectasis over infectious pneumonia.

[**2129-12-29**] ECG
Baseline artifact. The rhythm is most likely sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Repeat tracing is recommended.
No previous tracing available for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 44 year old man with ETOH abuse transferred
from OSH with necrotizing pancreatitis, ETOH withdrawal and DTs,
fever and GPC bacteremia.
.
#. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient initially presented with
abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting with lipase>3000 and
evidence of pancreatic 20-30% necrosis on CT scan. US without
stones. Surgery evaluated him and elected for conservative
management. With high fever and level of necrosis, meropenim was
started at the OSH. A 7 day course of this was completed. His
abd pain is now mostly resolved. He has developed an appetite,
but given the level of necrosis seen on the CT scan the mild DM
that he has developed it was recommended by surgery that he get
jejunal tube feedings for at least another week. After that
time, clears should be introduced and diet advanced, and if not
tolerated, TF resumed. He is followed by gastroenterology, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2523**] MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 86328**] for his crohn's disease and she
will follow him for his pancreatitis as well. Of note, at the
time of discharge his LFT's had returned to [**Location 213**] and his WBC's
had come down to 14 from a high of 22.
.
# ETOH Withdrawal/abuse: Patient reportedly agitated at OSH
secondary to ETOH withdrawal and has reported heavy daily ETOH
intake. No prior h/o withdrawal but has been in active
withdrawal there on ativan drip and also getting haldol for
agitation. Last ETOH [**12-22**] or [**12-23**]. Pt arrived to the ICU with
significance somnolence, minimally responsive but protecting his
airway. We d/c'd ativan drip and changed to valium PO as
tolerated. Pt's mental status significantly improved and patient
became more coherent.  CT head without acute changes. Continued
MVI, thiamine, folic acid. Strongly encouraged ETOH cessation.
At the time of discharge he was AAO x 3, awake, alert, and w/o
any s/s of withdrawal.
.
# GPC bacteremia: Most likely sources include catheter related
bloodstream infection given PICC line given TPN. Treated with
vanco and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] for now while awaiting speciation and
sensitivities, that returned as pansensative coag neg staph. He
was given ceftriaxone to complete a 2 week course to end [**1-10**]. A
midline was placed for this which should be removed after abx
therapy is complete.
.
# Fever/leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial secondary to
pancreatitis and bacteremia.  last check 14.
.
#B12 deficiency: The patient arrived to our institution on daily
B12 injections, presumably from a newly diagnosed B12
deficiency. he received 1 week of daily injections, planning for
1 month of qweek followed by qmonth afterwards.
.
#Diarrhea:while on zosyn, the patient had severe diarrhea.
infectious w/u neg. diarrhea stopped.
.
#crohn's disease:No issues. His mesalamine was held while sick,
but was restarted.
.
#Fe deficiency anemia:was also noticed to have low Tsat with fe
17 TIBC 190. Ferritin high from inflammation. did not start on
iron tabs given GI issues, but when stable should resume this.
Guaic was negative.
.
#diabetes:likely pancreatitis related. q6 FS while on TF with
insulin SS. Hopefully with not require DM therapy after
discharge.
