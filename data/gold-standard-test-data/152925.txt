Admission CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Left basilar consolidation representative of atelectasis or
early
pneumonia.
2. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Underlying apical emphysema. Right apical scarring.
.
[**2105-12-9**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly elongated. No left
atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function. Distal septal hyopkinesis is
suggested on some views, but could not be confirmed. Overall
systolic function is normal (LVEF >60%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function.
.
[**2105-12-11**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Dense
consolidation in the left lower lobe and lingula consistent with
atelectasis and pneumonia. Scattered bilateral ground glass
nodules likely represent infectious process. Limited evaluation
for empyema due to lack of IV contrast.
2. Extensive calcifications of the aorta and its branches.
3. Compression fractures of the thoracic spine of indeterminate
age.
.
[**2105-12-15**] REPEAT CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous
examination from [**12-11**], there is no major overall change in
the extent of pleural effusions. Unchanged extensive left lower
lobe consolidation. Regression of the pre-existing right than
left apical opacities. Unchanged extensive coronary and aortic
calcifications. No newly appeared pulmonary changes in the
interval.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of HTN presented with hypoxia,
dyspnea, found to have a LLL pneumonia.
.
# Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient was admitted to the ICU on
non-rebreather and acutely decompensated overnight.  She had
hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation which was
agreeable to her neice and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  She became
pressor dependent while intubated for pressures in the 60s/30s
and went in to A-fib with RVR (see below).  She was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2105-12-7**] for HAP.  Sputum cx and
bronchoscopy x2 failed to reveal infectious bacteria, but she
was kept on these antibiotics given her respiratory status and
pressor dependence.  After much discussion with HCP it was
decided that she would not want trachiotomy or PEG tube and
would prefer extubation, even if this leads to her demise.  The
decision has been made to make pt??????s goals of care comfort
oriented-  no further interventions, no heroic measures.  She
eventually was weaned off pressors on [**2105-12-18**] and was extubated.
 She finished a 14 day course of Vanc and Zosyn on [**2105-12-20**].
Since then has been afebrile. Her code status was changed back
to Full code.

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: resolved with 91-92%/RA.
As above, patient was intubated from [**2105-12-8**] to [**2105-12-18**].  SHe
continues to have incr plugging which has been treated with
aggressive suctioning and chest PT.  Was on Vanc/Zosyn which
ended on [**2105-12-20**].  She does continue to have a large left
pleural effusion, and right effusion, without clear infectious
etiology. This is most likely from CHF. It was unlikely that
doing thoracentesis would help her with improved oxygenation and
that the fluid would most likely reaccumulate from CHF. Also
given her kyphotic posture, she would unlikely go over her
current oxygen saturation level on room air.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient converted to A-fib with
RVR during her hypoxic respiratory failure.  Her rate was
initially controlled with IV diltiazem.  She was started on
amiodarone gtt and converted to sinus on [**2105-12-9**].  She was
transitioned to PO amiodarone for taper and will be tapered from
400mg [**Hospital1 **] to 400mg qday on [**2105-12-23**] which should last for 1
week, then be reduced to 200mg daily.
.
# Acute encephalopathy:  She developed change in mental status
as a result of her prolonged ICU stay, and gradually cleared
post extubation.
.
# Diastolic CHF, acute:  She developed bilateral pleural
effusions and interstitial edema with fluid resuscitation.  She
had an ECHO that showed a preserved EF.  Attempts were made at
diuresis but were limited by her low intravascular volume.
.
# Hypernatremia: Sodium went up to almost 148 after diuresis.
Diuresis was then held and she was given back fluid. She can be
diuresed at rehab PRN. Also her sodium will need to be checked
in [**3-15**] days to monitor.
.
# Diarrhea:  She developed diarrhea after antibiotic treatment
was completed.  She had two negative cdiffs.  She was treated
empirically with flagyl, which was discontinued after the c diff
was negative.
.
# Goals of care:  This was discussed repeatedly with her HCP,
who originally made her DNR/DNI when she was terminally
extubated.  However, since she survived extubation, they chose
to again make her full code.  This should continue to be
addressed.
