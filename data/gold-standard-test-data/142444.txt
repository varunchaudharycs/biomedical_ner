Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Small bowel obstruction
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Extended adhesiolysis.
3. Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis.


History of Present Illness:
This 79-year-old gentleman has had a previous total abdominal
colectomy here at this institution 5 years ago for C difficile
colitis. He has been fine in this period of time but has
recently presented with a bowel obstruction for the first time
about 5 days ago. We treated him with conservative care and
found that over the next 5 days he did not open up a known
transition point on a
CAT scan. His white blood cell count came down and he was stable
throughout this period.  NG tube suction care did improve his
abdominal distention. However, a follow-up CAT scan showed that
the transition point in the right lower quadrant near the
ileostomy site did not change significantly.

With these findings, I proposed an exploratory laparotomy for
adhesiolysis.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-1-22**] 12:34 PM
IMPRESSION: Distal ileal small-bowel obstruction with discrete
transition point identified in the right lateral mid abdomen.
Given the traction on multiple adjoining small bowel loops,
adhesion is highly suspect. Incidental findings are detailed
above.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-1-26**] 3:14 PM
IMPRESSION:
No significant change in findings consistent with small-bowel
obstruction.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-1-29**] 11:05 AM
IMPRESSION: Status post extubation with lingular atelectasis and
left lung volume loss. Please note the nasogastric tube is
likely in the post-pyloric position and retraction should be
considered for more optimal placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 year old male who presented with a small bowel
obstruction. He noted decreased ostomy output and has had nausea
and vomiting and abdominal distention.

Small bowel obstruction: He was NPO, with IVF and a NGT. We
noted no gas or stool in his ostomy bag. we attempted to manage
him conservatively, but a repeat CT on [**2172-1-26**] showed no
improvement in his distal ileal small-bowel obstruction with
discrete transition point identified in the right lateral mid
abdomen.
He went to the OR on [**2172-1-27**] for:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Extended adhesiolysis.
3. Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis.

He was NPO, with IVF and a NGT. The NGT was removed on POD 4. We
slowly advanced his diet as he had return of bowel function. He
was on TPN while we awaited return of bowel function. He was
tolerating fulls on POD 7 and regular diet POD 8 and the TPN was
weaned off.
His incision was C/D/I with a small amount of redness along the
distal part of the incision. The staples were left in place and
should be removed on Monday/Tuesday next week with steri strips
applied.

CHF: He has chronic diastolic documented heart failure. We
monitored his cardiac function and he received his home meds
when appropriate along with diuretics as described below.

Resp: He remained intubated post-operatively and was transferred
to the ICU. He was extubated on POD 2 and did well. He was on a
50% face tent in the ICU. Good pulmonary toilet was encouraged,
including ambulation and IS. We assess his respiratory status
and he received diuresis when appropriate. He continued on O2 by
nasal cannula once out on the floor.

GU: He was receiving fluid resuscitation and albumin initially
for hypovolemia. and then diuresis when appropriate. His BUN/Cr
remained slightly elevated and stable. He was having urinary
incontinence.

Hypernatremia: He is on chronic Torsemide treatment for his CHF.
His sodium was elevated since admission. His fluids were changed
to D5W. Hypernatremia likely due to diuretics and NGT suction.
His torsemide was held, as he did not appear fluid overloaded
and he was gently hydrated with D5W. His sodium slowly recovered
and was stable.

Endo: He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for blood glucose control. He
was taking Lantus and a Humalog sliding scale.
A cortisol stimulation test was negative.
