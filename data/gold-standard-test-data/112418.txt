Admission Date:  [**2128-10-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-11-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2076-2-29**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Surgery, Purple Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
female, status post right cephalic vein port placement and
laparoscopic-assisted jejunostomy tube placement on
[**2128-10-29**].

The patient presented on [**2128-10-30**] with nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.  The pain was described as
being in the midabdomen and occurs in waves.  The pain began
last night.  It was only somewhat relieved by Roxicet.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for esophageal cancer which was diagnosed approximately two
weeks prior.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Past surgical history as described
above.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications included Prevacid,
Roxicet, multivitamin, and calcium.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for a mom with
ovarian cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On examination, the
patient was noted to have a temperature of 98.9, pulse
was 76, blood pressure was 148/70, respiratory rate was 16,
and was saturating 98% on room air.  She appeared to be in
discomfort and nauseated.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination was significant for extraocular movements
which were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  There was no icterus demonstrated.
The oropharynx demonstrated mucous membranes were dry.  She
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart rate was
regular in rate and rhythm without any associated murmurs,
rubs, or heart sounds.  Her abdomen was distended,
tympanitic, with percussion tenderness near the incision.
Bowel sounds were hypoactive.  Extremities had trace edema
bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
obtained at the time indicated white blood cell count
was 8.5, hematocrit was 51.3, platelets were 508.  Her
Chemistry-7 demonstrated sodium was 138, potassium was 4.2,
chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen
was 13, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 112.  Her
liver function tests were normal.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A KUB obtained in the Emergency Room
indicated free air consistent with her laparoscopic
operation.  It also demonstrated gastric dilatation and one
small air/fluid level in the midabdomen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Purple
Surgery Service and treated with antiemetics, and medication,
as well as intravenous hydration for possible postoperative
ileus.

On hospital day two, she was noted to have increasing amounts
of gastric dilatation and increasing amounts of discomfort,
starting at approximately 11 o'clock that afternoon.

She was subsequently taken to the operating room for
re-exploration and revision of her jejunostomy tube
placement.  Please see the Operative Note per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for details of this operation.

Notably, during the course of this operation her course was
complicated by a aspiration upon anesthesia induction.
Approximately 2 liters of gastric content was estimated to
have entered the lungs and was rapidly suctioned out;
however, attempts at extubation failed, and the patient was
ultimately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a
presumed diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome
secondary to her aspiration.

On [**2128-10-31**], the patient was maintained intubated in
the Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day one, the
patient was converted to a prone position in the Intensive
Care Unit to help improve her respiratory status.  This
gradually improved.  The patient was returned to a supine
position on postoperative day two.  She was gradually weaned
from the ventilator over the next several days until she was
extubated on postoperative day eight.

On postoperative day seven, Pseudomonas pneumonia was grown
from her tracheal tube.  She was started on ceftazidime and
Zosyn that was ultimately converted from Zosyn to
ciprofloxacin.  Tube feeds were started on postoperative day
eight and were brought to goal by postoperative day thirteen.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2128-11-12**].
Just prior to discharge to the floor, it was noted that she
had swelling in her right arm.  An ultrasound was undertaken
to rule out deep venous thrombosis.  A thrombus was seen
within the distal jugular vein; consistent with deep venous
thrombosis from the right brachial vein to the subclavian.
The patient was started on a heparin drip at that time, and
over the next several days was converted toward Coumadin.  At
the time of discharge, however, she was not therapeutic on
the Coumadin; potentially from interference from the
antibiotics she was on, so the patient was ultimately
discharged on Lovenox.

On the final day of the patient's admission, her port was
accessed.  She was discharged home on tube feeds at 120 cc
per hour times 15 hours.  She was given oxygen therapy;
predominately because of anxiety that she was dealing with
over feelings of air hunger.  She was also given Lovenox
injections.  All of this was accomplished through the aid of
a visiting nurse who was going to help the patient with
delivery of medications, the Lovenox injections, and the tube
feeds, as well as assisting with monitoring Coumadin in
concert with the local physician.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal cancer.
2.  Status post jejunostomy tube placement and port placement
complicated by small-bowel obstruction requiring
re-exploration and jejunostomy tube revision, complicated by
acute respiratory distress syndrome subsequent to aspiration.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
1.  Enoxaparin sodium 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h.
2.  Warfarin 5 mg q.d. (crushed and given per jejunostomy
tube)
3.  Roxicet elixir 5 cc to 10 cc per jejunostomy tube q.4-6h.
as needed.
4.  Ranitidine 150 mg per jejunostomy tube (as an elixir).
5.  Sertraline HCl 50 mg per jejunostomy tube q.d.
6.  Colace elixir 100 mg per jejunostomy tube b.i.d.
7.  Albuterol 4 puffs inhaled q.4-6h. as needed.
8.  Tube feeds were also given with Impact full strength with
fiber at 120 cc per hour.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/INSTRUCTIONS:   Dressing changes were
to be done every day on the jejunostomy tube site per
[**Hospital6 407**].  An oxygen tank was also to be
provided to the patient.  At the time of discharge, the
patient was again receiving tube feeds at the above-mentioned
rates over the above-mentioned times and was tolerating this
without problems.  She was also taking full liquids at the
time of discharge.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow-up plans included seeing
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one to two weeks.
