History of Present Illness:
55 y.o. male with PMHx of DM, HTN, CAD s/p IMI with 3 stents to
RCA and recently diagnosed RCC who is transferred from [**Hospital **]for ongoing work-up of acute renal failure and change in
mental status.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2165-4-16**] for
chest and abdominal pain. He ruled out for an MI with cardiac
biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on
CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back
pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement). His
constipation was treated aggressively with medications and
disimpaction with minimal effect. On day 4 of his
hospitalization, he was febrile to 104 with a leukocytosis to 14
and was pan-cultured while Vancomycin and Zosyn were started
empirically with specific concern for a PIV infection suggested
by surrounding erythema and edema. Blood cultures later grew
GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and
reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities. Zosyn
was thus discontinued. In the setting of infection, patient
became delirious, noted to be attempting to grab things from the
air and talking to people in the room. Of note, patient was
continued on narcotics, reportedly at the wife's insistence
given concern for narcotic withdrawal. Neurology was consulted
and recommended a head CT which was unremarkable, leaving them
to conclude that the mental status was toxic/metabolic in the
setting of infection and narcotic use. He was started on
Ceftriaxone 2 grams daily for CNS coverage though no LP was
performed. On day 5, patient was noted to develop acute renal
failure with a creatinine of 3, up from 1.3 and was also anuric.
CKs were checked to evaluate renal failure from rhabdomyolysis
and were not likely contributing at a level of 361. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of his renal failure
progressing to the point of needing HD, since [**Hospital3 77641**]
no HD facilities.
.
Upon arrival, patient was noted to vomit and had reportedly
vomited in route to [**Hospital1 18**]. He additionally started experiencing
low-amplitude, rhythmic clonus of his hands and legs, became
transiently hypoxic and was not verbally responsive. There was
concern for seizing and patient was urgently intubated to
protect his airway. Discussion with the patient's wife, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN,
revealed that the patient has never had a seizure disorder and
does not drink alcohol. Additionally, he had a CT scan with
contrast at [**Hospital1 2025**] 3 days prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **]as a part of his RCC work-up and the wife expressed concern for
contrast-induced nephropathy. Patient was then ordered for a
stat head CT given the mental status and neurology was consulted
for further assistance with management.

For complete blood culture results, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] and
ask for microbiology.

[**2165-4-21**] CXR: ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is approximately
45 mm from the carina, standard position. Lung volumes are low
and there are several areas of plate-like atelectasis. Heart
size borderline enlarged. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
No pneumothorax.

[**2165-4-21**] Abd XR: Diffuse colonic dilatation without air within
the rectum. This may represent ileus. Close followup is
recommended.

[**2165-4-21**] Left foot XR: The patient is status post partial
amputation of the first through fifth metatarsals and resection
of multiple phalanges. Portions of the 1st distal phalanx, the
toe of the second (?) digit, and the fifth toe are present.
There is a focus of air overlying the surgical bed of the first
ray, representing either air within an area of ulceration or
subcutaneous emphysema. There is relative lucency of the
adjoining portion of the first metatarsal bony remnant
suspicious for osteomyelitis.
Correlation with any previous (outside) radiographs and history
of recent
debridement is recommended for full assessment. The posterior
calcaneus is obscured by overlying material and not fully
evaluated on this examination.

[**2165-4-22**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

[**2165-4-22**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to
the pattern of widespread alpha range activity alternating with
relative suppression of the background without reactivity which
is suggestive of an alpha coma pattern. This abnormality
suggests a severe encephalopathy. Medications and metabolic
disturbances may be causes but this pattern can also be seen in
post-anoxic patients. There were no lateralized or epileptiform
features seen and no electrographic seizures were seen in this
recording.

[**2165-4-22**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

[**2165-4-22**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity enlargement and
preserved global  biventricular systolic function.

[**2165-4-25**] TEE: No intracardiac mass or vegetations. No significant
valvular regurgitation. Complex, mobile atheroma in descending
aorta, simple atheroma in the aortic arch.

[**2165-4-25**] MRI/MRV Head w/o Contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction.
2. Patent major dural venous sinuses. Decreased signal in the
posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus, including the
torcular herophili and the right sigmoid sinus, likely relates
to slow flow rather than thrombosis given the lack of increased
signal on the sagittal T1-weighted sequences. If there is
continued concern based on the clinical presentation, CTA and
CTV, if serum creatinine level is appropriate or a followup MR
venogram can be considered.

[**2165-4-30**] CT SPINE: IMPRESSION:
Limited study due to patient habitus and motion, and non-
myelographic technique, with:
1. No definite epidural or subdural abscess collection seen in
the thoracolumabr spine.
2. Apparent hyperdense focus in the ventral epidural space at
the T2 level, most likely artifactual.
If this remains of clinical concern, follow-up CT study,
dedicated CT-
myelography or MRI, when feasible, might be helpful for further
evaluation. N.B. The patient successfully underwent MRI of the
brain (at this institution) as recently as [**2165-4-25**].
3. No fracture or malalignment.
4. Mild spondylosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with no canal
compromise.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate bibasilar
consolidations; differential diagnosis includes atelectasis,
aspiration and bacterial pneumonia.

[**2165-5-2**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis and no
perinephric collections seen in this very limited mobile renal
ultrasound study.

[**2165-5-9**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Definite abnormal focus of tracer accumulation in the left
foot correlating
with known sites of ulceration/infection.

2. Indeterminate foci in the right proximal thigh medially or
scrotum and the
soft-tissues of the left knee medially, for which clinical
correlation is
needed.

3. Possible nasal infection or ethmoid sinusitis.

[**2165-5-13**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and
poorly
modulated background indicative of a mild to moderate
encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infections are among
the most
common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing
although
encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There were no
epileptiform
discharges noted.



Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old male had prolonged hospital course complicated by
multiple infections, mental status changes, and renal failure
who requires long term antibiotic therapy.

# Sepsis/Meningitis:  He was transferred from [**Location (un) **] in the
setting of high-grade MSSA bacterimia and mental status changes,
and intubated on arrival because of question seizures and
concern for airway protection.  Before speciation returned, he
was initially managed with vancomycin and zosyn, and then
switched to nafcillin given MSSA.  He also required pressors
intermittently on the day after presenting but this was
ultimately thought to represent a low-baseline blood pressure,
and pressors were subsequently discontinued, with MAPs that
remained greater than 65.  The source of his infection was
unclear but thought to be secondary to left foot ulcers, which
also grew MSSA.  This was evaluated by podiatry and vascular,
and he was found to have osteomyelitis of the first toe, and
would possibly need L BKA for definitive treatment. There was
also concern for encephalopathy given his worsening mental
status prior to and after transfer, and neurology was consulted.
 An LP was initially deferred because of the unlikelihood of him
developing meningitis during his hospitalization at [**Location (un) **], as
he did not initially present with symptoms suggestive of this
condition.  However, it was later performed and was consistent
with bacterial meningitis, and antibiotics were changed to
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.  ACV and CTX were then
discontinued as CSF culture returned negative and other cultures
continued to be MSSA.  He was extubated after 10 days and
tolerate this well.  Vancomycin was continued following transfer
to floor.  A thorough work up for source of infection, including
LP and left foot imaging, did not yield a source.  As patient
continued to improve clinically, the decision was made to treat
empirically with vancomycin until [**6-5**], dosing during HD.

# Altered mental status: After extubation, patient was
delirious, not responding to commands, and with jerking motions
of his head.  An MRI/MRV was negative for structural abnormality
on [**2165-4-25**], after EEG showed possible alpha-coma waves.  His
mental status cleared after 4 days extubation suggesting ICU
narcosis.  He began to follow commands on [**2165-5-4**].  Following
transfer to floor, fentanyl patch was discontinued in favor of
morphine PO.  The patient's mental status continued to improve
without further intervention.  At time of discharge, patient was
oriented to time, person, and place.

# ? hypodense region in TT2 area of spinal cord:  Intial concern
was for abscess with cord compression as patient was febrile
with MSSA infection and not moving his lower extremities for
several days pre-extubation [**2165-4-30**].  Neurosurgery was consulted
and recommended CT myelogram or MRI to better define this
lesion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (radiology) stated CT myelogram was not
indicated and suggested MRI.  Mr. [**Known lastname 77642**] was unable to fit in
the MRI scanner far enough to scan his spine so he was watched
clinically and improved. Consider f/u MRI in open MRI scanner as
an outpatient.

# Respiratory failure:  He was intubated shortly after ariving
at [**Hospital1 18**] because of concern for airway protection in the setting
of question seizures, as he had low-amplitude clonic movements
of his hands and legs. His vent settings were weaned and plan
for extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the
tubing to inflate the cuff.  He was extubated after 9 days and
his respiratory status continue to improve.  EEG obtained showed
no epileptiform activity.  Patient had stable respiratory for
the duration of his hospitalization following extubation.

# Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to
transfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal
failure.  Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine
was consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no
clear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.  He had to be
started on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia. At
that point his creatinine was 9.8. He continued on HD and
eventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and
the femoral HD catheter was pulled. His urine output improved,
although his need for HD continued.  The patient had another
dialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent
self-removal secondary to agitation.  A tunnelled catheter HD
line was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.  The patient
continued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's
creatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.  The patient will
continue HD following discharge and will be followed by the
nephrology service.

# Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was
hypertensive to 200s/80s.  His losartan was held for renal
protection in hopes that his renal function would recover.  He
was started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control.
Pt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer
with the current medication regimen at discharge.

# L foot ulcer: Likely seeding to blood causing sepsis. ESR and
CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for
osteomyelitis.
- Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they
would defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of
patient prior to surgery.
- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on
floor on vancomycin
- pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]

# Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required
large doses of narcotics prior to admission.  Per family, the
plan was to replace his hip, but he was battling recurrent
infections from L toe delaying this.  Morphine PO with scheduled
tylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.

# Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended
transverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large
narcotic use for R hip pain.  General surgery was consulted and
felt that it was improving and did not require surgical
intervention. He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan
was started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.  Following
transfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and
change in opiate use.

# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on
ASA/plavix.  He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for
unclear reasons.

# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of
elevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **]
consulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good
control at time of discharge.  This regimen will be continued at
rehab.

# Renal Cell Carcinoma: Is seen at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Per family, he was
recently diagnosed ~2 cm mass, CT torso without mets.  He was
scheduled for cryoablation prior to this hospitalization.

# Gout:  Renally-dosed Allopurinol and then d/c'd given renal
failure.

# Communication: [**Name (NI) **] wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77643**] - cell

# Patient was made DNR, but okay to re-intubate for respiratory
failure post-extubation.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred from another hospital for management of
your acute kidney failure in the setting of a high-grade blood
infection with a bacteria called MSSA, thought to be introduced
from our infected left foot ulcer. You were intubated in the ICU
in order to protect your airways due to concern for seizure. You
also had an ileus thought to be precipitated by high doses of
narcotics; this has now resolved. You were initiated on
hemodialysis for your renal failure with improvement. Your ICU
course here was further complicated by MRSA bacteral meningitis
and pneumonia, for which you were treated with antibtioics. You
were able to be weaned off your ventilator.  You were
transferred from the ICU to the floor.  Your medical problems
contributed to confusion, which improved with time.  Your kidney
function declined from your medical issues, and you were started
on dialysis for support.  When you left the hospital, you still
required dialysis, but your kidney function has improved
greatly.  Your chronic hip pain is being treated well with
medication.  You are being dischaged to a rehab center, where
they will focus on getting you stronger as you continue to
recover from your long hospitalization.

There were multiple changes made to your medication, your rehab
providers will be responsible for your new regimen.

Please take all medications as prescribed.

Call your doctor or 911 if you develop chest pain, difficulty
breathing, fevers >101, dizziness, bleeding, or any other
concerning symptoms.
