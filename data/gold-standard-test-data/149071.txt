CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pericardial effusion
REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION: Monitoring post pericardial drain
placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial drain placement [**2159-8-9**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90050**] is a 69F with a history of recently diagnosed
synchronous stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer
(adenocarcinoma by bronchial brushings) and renal cell
carcinoma, currently s/p left nephrectomy and undergoing
chemotherapy and radiation. She underwent CT scan of her chest
for re-staging of her lung cancer on [**2159-8-6**], which demonstrated
an increasingly large pericardial effusion (had been previously
noted on PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**]). She has recently been experiencing
worsening shortness of breath at home, which she notices only
with exertion such as carrying a full basket of laundry. She has
had some associated cough, but no sputum production. In
addition, about 3 weeks ago she was seen at [**Hospital3 1443**]
hospital for chest pain; she was ruled out for MI and planned
for outpatient echocardiogram, which would have been today but
she cancelled given her oncology appointments. She has not had a
recurrence of the chest pain. She was seen today in clinic today
by her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who noted her complaints of
worsening dyspnea on exertion and referred her to the ED for
echocardiogram to evaluate for possible tamponade. In the ED,
echocardiogram showed brief right atrial collapse and impaired
filling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponade
physiology.  She was evaluated by interventional cardiology and
taken to the catheterization lab for pericardial fluid removal.
.
She underwent pericardial drain placement with ~400 cc of bloody
fluid removed, followed by rapid drainage of another ~150cc into
the drainage bag. She tolerated the procedure well. Immediate
post-procedure echo showed small residual pericardial effusion
with no Fluid was sent for cytology. Her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and updated with the events of the procedure. He
requested transfusion of 2 units pRBCs for anemia.
.
On the floor, she reports feeling well. No current SOB at rest
or chest pain (only very mild site tenderness with drain
placement).
.
Of note, her cancer history is well-documented in OMR note by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] dated [**2159-8-9**]. Briefly, she initially presented in
[**Month (only) 404**] with hematuria, and further work up revealed both a
large 9-cm renal mass and a RUL 9-cm mass with mediastinal
nodes. Based on renal biopsy (RCC, clear cell type) and
bronchial brushings (likely adenocarcinoma) these are two
separate cancers.  She has been treated with chemotherapy with
cysplatin and paclitaxel (start date [**2159-7-12**]) and radiation
therapy to the chest, in addition to unilateral nephrectomy in
4/[**2159**].
.
On review of systems, she endorses bilateral chronic hip pain
with walking (not new or changed), and dark stool secondary to
iron use. She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery (though had one GI bleed on aspirin in [**2154**]), myalgias,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills, nightsweats or rigors. No recent cold or flu
symptoms. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies
dysuria or other urinary symptoms. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea (sleeps with one flat pillow), ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  All of the other review of
systems were negative.

MICROBIOLOGY:
- Pericardial fluid [**2159-8-9**]: Gram stain negative for organisms
or PMNs.
- Pericardial fluid culture [**2159-8-9**] (blood culture bottles): NO
GROWTH
- MRSA screen [**2159-8-9**]: PENDING

IMAGING:
.
- ECHO [**2159-8-9**] (pre-procedure): Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right
ventricular cavity is unusually small. with normal free wall
contractility. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. Stranding is visualized
within the pericardial space c/w organization. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling. IMPRESSION:
Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with most of the
fluid located over the right atrium and inferolateral wall.
There is relatively little fluid over the right ventricular free
wall. There is variation in tricuspid inflows, along with brief
right atrial collapse and impaired filling of the right
ventricle consistent with early tamponade physiology.
.
- ECHO [**2159-8-9**] (post-procedure): Effusion is loculated. No
significant respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
flows. IMPRESSION: Limited study, Doppler images only. No
significant variation in mitral inflows. Pericardial fluid
amount is reduced.
.
- ECHO [**2159-8-11**] (post-procedure):  Focused views s/p pericardial
drainage. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a residual small pericardial effusion along the
infero-lateral wall and right atrium. The effusion is very small
anterior to the right ventricle and significantly improved
compared to the prior study dated [**2159-8-9**].There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 69 y/o woman with renal cell
carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed early [**2159**],
undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, who presents with DOE and
worsening pericardial effusion with evidence of early tamponade
by echocardiogram. Admitted to CCU for monitoring s/p
pericardial drain placement.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Pericardiocentesis was performed with
immediate drainage of 400cc sanguinous fluid. Overnight, another
~450cc sanguinous fluid drained, and samples were sent for gram
stain, protein content, culture, electroyltes and cytology.
Post-procedure echo showed a small loculated residual effusion
with no evidence of tamponade physiology. Cytology was negative
for malignacy, but suspicion remains high for a malignant
etiology. Pulsus was followed throughout her hospital course,
and at the time of post-procedure echo pulses was 12 by doppler.
Pt was asymptomatic at the time of discahrge and specifically
denied CP/SOB/DOE, palpitations or lightheadedness. If
pericardial effusion reaccumulates, would consider CT surgery
consult for pericardial window.
.
# RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: No
treatments were undertaken during this hosptial course. Pt was
discahrged with Heme/Onc follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# TACHYCARDIA - Pt remained tachycardic to the 100-120s
throughout her course. Initially it was felt this may have been
[**2-28**] tamponade physiology, but tachycardia persisted s/p
pericardiocentesis. She was then transfused 2U pRBCs at the
request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and bolused 1L NS due to concern for
anemia/hypovolemia, but tachycardia persisted. Review of clinic
visits revealed that she has been persistently  tachycardic for
several months, which may be related to the small loculated
effusion that was not accessed by the tap. The patient denied
pain throughout her course and refused any pain medicaitons.
Orthostatics were checked at discahrge and were normal.
.
# ANEMIA: Her Hct has trended down over the past 6 months. This
is likely related to chonric disease, and pt was transfused 2U
pRBCs during this admission. She is taking Fe supplementation,
which was continued during her hospitalization.
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: She had a low grade leukocytosis throughout her
admission, which is consistent with her baseline. Suspect this
is related to her malignancies. She remained afebrile and
normotensive throughout her course, pericardial and urine
cultures were negative and CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary
process.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
# HYPERTENSION: Generally normotensive. Continued home meds
(amlodipine 10 mg PO daily, HCTZ 25 mg PO daily) with holding
parameters.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continued rosuvastatin 10 mg PO QHS.
.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Denies current depression. States she
takes Xanax once daily in the mornings. Continued Effexor XR 150
mg PO daily. Continued Xanax 0.5 mg PO daily (in AM).
.
# OSTEOPOROSIS: Continued alendronate 70 mg PO Q week (Mondays).
.
TRANSITION OF CARE: Pt was discharged home with Heme/Onc follow
up. She was also scheduled for an outpatient echo that should be
followed up by her PCP/Oncologist. She was instructed to return
to the ER if she experiecned worsening SOB/CP, as this may
represet reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname 90050**],

It was a pleasure caring for you at the [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for a condition called
pericardial tamponade. This is caused by fluid surrounding the
heart, and it can cause the heart to not beat effectively. For
this you underwent pericardiocentesis, a procedure where a
doctor drains the fluid with a needle to restore the normal
functioning of the heart. After this procedure we performed
another Echocardiogram to confirm that the fluid had not
reaccumulated and felt you were safe to return home.

During this hospitalization, we made NO CHANGES to your
medicatios.

It will be important for you to follow up the results of the
cytology from your pericardial fluid analysis with you
oncologist.
