Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
invasive sqamous scalp ca

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement, neurosurgical intervention cancelled,

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with afib, cad, dm who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] for lesion on scalp (can see
brain matter). She was evaluated as an outpatient intially by
dermatology that did a biopsy of the scalp mass and she was
diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. The ulcerative lesion
eroding skull extending intracranially and was to have
neurosurgical intervention but the patient was supertheraputic
INR of 7.7 so she was sent to the MICU. She was reversed with
reversed with 10 IV K, 2u FFP. She was also noted to have arf
with cr of 2, anuric, dry on exam with a
sodium 158-->161. She received a NS bolus and then D5W and
avoiding lasix and acei given renal failure, renal ultrasound
with R hydro and pelvic mass (family does not want w/u). Patient
was placed on vanc and cetriaxone for meningitis proprolaxis
since there is CSF communicating with skin secondary to scc.
Patient is having PICC placed in the AM for long-term abx and
fluids. Cultures are pending.
Family is aware of poor prognosis and she is dnr/dni, family
wants conservative med management.

CT head:
TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast images performed in an outside
hospital
([**Hospital3 **]) were submitted for review. No
reconstructions were
available. No formal report was provided.

FINDINGS:

Within the brain parenchyma, there is global parenchymal
atrophy, indicated by
enlargement of the ventricles and sulci. There is also
periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensity, consistent with small
vessel ischemic
disease. A right cerebellar lacunar infarct is also noted. There
is no
hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. There is no shift of normally
midline
structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears
preserved.

There is a large destructive lesion involving the vertex of the
calvarium.
There is no underlying brain mass lesion or brain abscess,
although there is
an extra- axial, likely subdural, soft tissue/fluid component to
this lesion,
although this is difficult to evaluate due to volume averaging
at the vertex
and the lack of reconstructions. The lesion at the vertex causes
significant
osseous destruction. There is subcutaneous gas, which also
extends
intracranially, with resultant pneumocephalus.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive destructive lesion involving the calvarial vertex,
with
intracranial extension indicated by pneumocephalus and
extra-axial,
intracranial soft tissue/fluid component. This does not appear
to be of
primary CNS etiology. Differential includes infectious process
or a
subcutaneous or osseous malignancy. Further evaluation with
contrast-enhanced
MRI is recommended.

2. Small vessel ischemic disease, lacunar infarcts, and global
parenchymal
atrophy. There are no brain mass lesions or brain abscesses
identified.

Renal ultrasound [**2163-6-7**]:
FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 9 cm in length. There is no
left-sided
hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 9.5 cm in length.
There is
moderate right-sided hydronephrosis. There is no renal mass or
stone. There
is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass, which cannot be further
characterized.
Bladder is not visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis.
2. Non-specific, large cystic pelvic mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with h.o CHF, DM, afib, who
presented with invasive scalp squamous cell carcinoma with
intracranial extension who died after code status was CMO.
.
# CMO - Had family meeting [**6-10**]. Discussed to stop vital signs,
non-essential medications other than eye drops, pain meds, and
PO antibiotics. Patient was continued on maintainance IV fluids.
.
# Pain control - This was the family's primary goal of care.
There were multiple etiologies of the pain including her chonic
right shoulder pain, sacral decubiti with possible abcess,
painful scalp leison, or the >15cm pelvic mass. Pain control was
transitioned from outpatient oxycontin pills to fenanyl patch
and oxycodone liquid. Patient was comfortably sedated and only
required additional pain medication when she was moved.
Palliative care was involved in pain management.
.
# Squamous cell ca, intracranial- The carcinoma developed over
an unknown time period. It probably developed before her care to
nursing home facility given that there was a rapid decline in
her functional status and intracraninal involvement of the
tumor.  She was evaluated as an outpatient by dermatology and
was determined to have a squamous cell ca as per biopsy on [**5-25**].
Initially, the family wanted to have a neurosurgical
intervention, but the patient's INR was 7.7 so she was
transferred to the MICU for reversal. Later, the family decided
not to have surgery once it became apparent that the morbity was
high. Patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for
meningitis ppx and this was changed to PO cefepoxidime after a
family meeting determining that she would not want IV
antibiotics. Wound care was done to address her head wound.
.
# Resolved hypovolemia/ acute renal failure/ hypernatremia -
secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia in the
setting of diruetic use. Cr 2.0 on admission, most recent
baseline at [**Hospital1 18**] 1.1. This was the reason for the PICC line
placement and why the family wanted IVF.
.
# Pelvic mass - There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass seen
on renal ultrasound. This may be a source of pain.
.
# afib not on anticoagulation - Patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation but was placed on anticoagulation for a recent
phelbiltis. Given that the scalp wound oozes blood, the family
has decided that they do not want anticoagulation.
.
# DM-HISS
