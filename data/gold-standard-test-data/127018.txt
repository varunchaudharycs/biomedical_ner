cxr [**2192-3-15**]:
FINDINGS: There is suggestion of COPD. There is a linear opacity
at the left mid lung likely small atelectasis. There are
bibasilar atelectasis. There is probable RML atelectasis. There
is no pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Hilar silhouette is normal. There is tortuosity of thoracic
aorta. Mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. No pneumothorax.

[**2192-3-15**] ct c spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine with
fusion of C3-C4 and posterior osteophytes at C4-C5 and C6-C7
impinging on the thecal sac anteriorly and placing the cord for
higher risk of injury in appropriate mechanism.
2. Small osseous fragment superior and posterior of C3 vertebral
body could be a small fracture fragment of uncertain chronicity.
Correlate with point tenderness. Comparison with prior imaging,
if available, would be beneficial. If clinical concern, MRI of
the spine can be done for evaluation.

[**2192-3-15**] ct sinus:
1. No evidence of fracture.
2. Mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses and
sphenoid sinus.
3. Left preseptal small hematoma.

[**2192-3-15**] ct head without contrast:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or
masses. There
is no shift of midline structures. Ventricles and sulci are
normal in size
and configuration. There is no evidence of fracture. There is a
left
preseptal hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 87 year-old male with a history of orthostatic
hypotension and recent fall c/b trauma to face who presents with
facial swelling and ?angioedema.

Facial swelling: possibly angioedema given recent initiation of
ACEi but also possibly related to the fall and trauma.  At this
point will avoid ACEi or [**Last Name (un) **] and have placed lisinopril on his
allergy list.

SYNCOPE / AUTNOMIC DYSFUNCTION: symptoms of presyncope
chronically (for 2 years) and a formal diagnosis of autnomic
dysfunction has been made with tilt table testing here at [**Hospital1 18**]
in [**2190**].  He had previously been on midodrine and florinef but
was hypertensive so these were discontinued.  He has most
recently been on flomax and lisinopril and was more orthostatic.
 For now I have changed his regimen to norvasc 2.5mg po daily
and thigh high TEDS stockings.  In addition given his CT C spine
findings and his recurrent falls I feel that it would be
dangerous for him to ambulate without an assist device.  I have
recommended a walker with a seat so that he can sit down
immediately should he feel lightheaded, I have strongly urged he
use this at all times given his high risk to fall, and have
suggested if this is ineffective he may at somepoint be
committed to a wheelchair given his severe autnomic dysfunction.
 In addition he will have a home safety evaluation by VNA.  He
had no acute fractures as a result of his fall.  I have also
checked a B12 which was 400 and an RPR which was non reactive
given that he had a + romberg sign suggestive of posterior
column spinal cord disease.
