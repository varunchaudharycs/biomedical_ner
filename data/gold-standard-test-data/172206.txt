Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old female  with stage IIIC ovarian
cancer. She is status post one cycle of  carboplatin and Taxol
chemotherapy alone. She is status post 5  doses of IV
chemotherapy with intraperitoneal cisplatin given on
day #2 and status post 4 doses of intraperitoneal Taxol given on

day #8. She has just received her last dose of chemotherapy last

Thursday. Today is cycle #6, day #13 of chemotherapy. She was
seen in clinic today for an acute complaint of RUQ pain.  [**Known firstname 2429**]
states that she
has a deep right upper quadrant pain on palpation, movement, and

inspiration. She rated this pain a [**9-5**]. No actual chest pain,
no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation. She is moving her
bowels and going to the bathroom without problems. She is eating

well as well.

Patient was tachycardic in clinic. given pleuritic pain and
hyprecoagulable state, she was sent to ED for evaluation.  IN ED
patient had CT Torso which revealed a saddle embolus and  right
sided saddle embolus with near complete occlusion of RLL pulm.
artery, with wedge shaped consolidation in RLL likely
representing infarction as well as a Left common femoral vein
acute DVT, as well as left gonadal vein thrombus. Patient wAs
started on IV heparin and remained hemodynamically statble
throught her 9 hour emergency room visit.

Given fever, patient also cultured and given dose of cefepime in
ED.

Upon arrival to the floor: Patient VS: 100.1 150/100 110 20 100%
RA. [**Known firstname 2429**] continues to experience RUQ pain, R sided pleuritic
chest pain and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  She
denies any chest pain at rest, denies any lightheadness,
dizziness or palpitations. ROS is otherwise negative.

CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Opacities in both bases are
likely secondary to atelectasis. Followup PA and lateral
examinations may be helpful when the patient is clinically able.

CTA CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
unremarkable. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial
effusion. No significant axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is identified. The central airways are patent
bilaterally.

There is a large saddle embolus in the right main pulmonary
artery, which nearly completely occludes the right lower lobe
pulmonary artery, and there is evidence of wedge shaped,
parenchymal opacity localized to the right lower lobe, which may
represent pulmonary infarction. Some contrast passes the
embolism to the right middle and right upper lobe pulmonary
arteries, and the lung parenchyma in these areas is
unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on the
left side. The left lung fields are clear.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances
homogeneously, without evidence of focal intrahepatic lesion.
There is no evidence of ascites. There is no evidence of intra-
or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is
evidence of a subcutaneous Chemo-Port in the left abdominal
wall, with a peritoneal catheter extending into the left lower
quadrant. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast
normally bilaterally. The ureters are normal in appearance,
without evidence of hydronephrosis. Within the midpole of the
right kidney, there is a low attenuation focus measuring 1.4 x
1.8 cm, which contains low-density fluid, consistent with a
simple cyst. Smaller hypodensities are seen throughout both
kidneys, but are too small to definitively characterize. The
stomach and opacified loops of intraabdominal bowel are
unremarkable. There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Expansile, centrally located thrombus is seen within the left
gonadal vein, beginning inferiorly at the level of the mid psoas
muscle and extending proximally up to and involving the
confluence at the superior mesenteric vein. No thrombus is seen
more proximally than the SMV. Expansile, acute thrombus is also
seen within the left common femoral vein, extending proximally
to the level of the pubic symphysis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
pelvic loops of bowel, urinary bladder, and distal ureters are
unremarkable. The patient is status post hysterectomy. No free
fluid is seen within the pelvis, and no abnormal pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.

CT head:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. No enhancing lesions identified.
3. Mottled appearance of the calvarium, suggesting possible
renal osteodystrophy.

EKG: nl sinus; Left axis deviation; t wave inversion III; .5mm
st depression V5-6

Brief Hospital Course:
.
A/P: 70 y.o. woman with a history of metastatic ovarian CA
presenting with chest pain, found to have large pulmonary
embolus with significant DVT clot burden, hemodynamically
stable, saturating well on RA, now on lovenox.
.
# PE with large DVT clot burden. The patient presented with
chest pain and was found on CT scan to have a large saddle
embolus with near complete occlusion of the RLL pulmonary artery
and a likely infarct of the RLL. CT scan also revealed left
common femoral vein DVT and Left gonadal vein thrombus. It is
likely that these clots occurred secondary to hypercoaguability
of malignancy. The patient was hemodynamically stable. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia without clear signs of Right heart
strain. The patient was initiated on IV heparin and briefly sent
to the ICU out of concern for her considerable clot burden and
potential hemodynamic complications. The patient had a fever,
likely secondary to her clot burden. The patient was changed to
lovenox for long-term anticoagulation. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her admission, saturating well
(>95%) on RA and with improved chest pain. Lower extremity
ultrasound was ordered to further assess clot burden. However,
the ultrasound tech was not available to complete the study and
after discussion with radiology it was felt that the CT scan
provided adequate imaging of the deep veins. There was no change
of management to be made based upon the Lower extremity
ultrasound study. The patient will likely require life-long
lovenox vs. coumadin therapy.
.
# Anemia. On admission, the patient's Hct dropped from 34.4 to a
nadir of 26.4 in the setting of new anticoagulation. The patient
had no obvious source of bleeding. The patient's Hct stabilized
and trended upward prior to discharge.
.
# Ovarian CA. Intravenous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy per
primary oncologist.
.
# HTN. Well controlled on CCB and diuretic.
.
# Leukopenia. Likely secondary to chemotherapy. Not neutropenic
by numbers.
.
# Fever. Resolved. Likely secondary to clot burden. Cultures
without growth to date.
.
# Hyperlipidemia. The patient's statin therapy was held while
LFT's were elevated, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
This therapy was re-instated prior to discharge as her LFT's
normalized.

Metastatic ovarian cancer
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia


Discharge Condition:
Good, saturating well on room air with decreased chest pain.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with chest pain. This was likely due to blood
clots in your lungs. These clots came from the blood vessels in
your legs and abdomen. This is likely a complication from your
ovarian cancer. You were started on a medication, called lovenox
(also called enoxaparin), to thin your blood and prevent further
clotting. Please inject this medication as you have been taught
twice a day.
.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] in the oncology clinic on [**2156-12-2**] for further management of your ovarian cancer and blood
clot complications.
.
Take all medications as prescribed. The only change in your
medications is the addition of Lovenox (also called enoxaparin).
.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new or
worsening chest pain, shortness of breath or other concerning
symptoms.
