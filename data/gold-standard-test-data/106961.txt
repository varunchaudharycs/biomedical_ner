Chief Complaint:
Weakness and fatigue

None


History of Present Illness:
59M w/pmhx CHF (last EF 55-60%), afib, elevated LFTs, chronic LE
wounds (recent admission for cellulitis on [**6-14**]), hx of PE and
atrial thrombus, presented to clinic today for F/U. Pt had hx of
multiple missed appointments and F/U labs were drawn today.
Reported losing ~20lbs within the past month. Pt appeared
euvolemic and had extensive chronic LE ulcerations (pt was seen
in vascular clinic immediately prior to general medicine
appointment and was started on Keflex).
Referred to ED due to hyponatremia/[**Last Name (un) **] found on labs.

On presentation to the emergency Department the patient reports
that he has had occasional exertional shortness of breath,
reports no symptoms at rest. He denies chest pain at any point.
He reports that due to neuropathy he hasn't felt any pain in his
leg ulcers but notices that they are significantly more
erythematous and draining more fluid. Additionally he reports
that he has not taken any of his A. fib medications for several
days.

In the ED his initial vitals were 98.4 130 90/52 18 100. An EKG
showed afib @ 115, NA, lateral minimal stdep likely demand
related. no STE. He recieved 1L NS and was restarted on his
metorolol and diltiazem. His digoxin was held.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old male with a past medical history of systolic
congestive heart failure (last EF 55-60%), atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, transaminitis secondary to cirrhosis, chronic lower
extremity stasis dermatitis (recent admission for cellulitis on
[**2173-6-14**]), history of pulmonary embolus and atrial thrombus who
presented from clinic with with a significant hyponatremia,
elevated lactate, and acute kidney injury.

#. HYPONATREMIA: Etiology was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in
the setting of over-aggressive diuretic use and decreased
dietary intake of sodium.  Patient had started dieting, eating
less salt and drinking more water.  He presented with
hypotension and tachycardia.  Patient also presented with acute
kidney injury, elevated lactate, fractional excretion of sodium
less than 1, low urine sodium, and elevated creatinine and BUN
all suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia as the etiology. While
in the MICU his sodium was corrected with normal saline and his
urine and serum sodium trended. Once his sodium was trending
upward he was transferred to the medicine floor.  His torsemide
was held and then restarted on [**8-7**] on an every other day dosing
schedule, and he should follow up with his PCP for repeat lab
testing.

# HYPOTENSION / TACHYCARDIA - Though initially concerned for
SIRS/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possible
source of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasis
ulcers.  CXR, UA, blood cultures were all negative for signs of
infection.  He did not have fever of systemic signs of
infection.  Initially he met systemic inflammatory response
syndrome criteria with a possible source. He was started on
vancomycin and unasyn empirically. On re-evaluation he remained
afebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis.
His vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kept
on per his vascular physicians prescription. Hypotension was
likely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the setting
of overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactive
tachycardia.  Metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held for
hypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  He
was monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrial
fibrillation with RVR.  However, he had asymptomatic sinus
tachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  This was
likely because his home medications were held, and his
tachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, and
diltiazem at his home doses.  Torsemide was restarted on an
every other day dosing schedule.

#. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Chronic issue. On coumadin, metoprolol,
diltizem, and digoxin at home. In the MICU, he became mildly
hypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so his
metoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  Upon trasnfer to
floor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcations
and metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia,
particularly with exertion with PT. He should follow up with his
PCP regarding titration of his rate control. His INR was
subtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. Digoxin
was continued and level was not toxic.

#. Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal and related to
hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improved
with holding torsemide and administration of IVF. His creatine
and BUN were trended and his creatine trended downward with IV
fluids.

#. STASIS DERMATITIS WITH POSSIBLE SUPER IMPOSED CELLULITIS:
While in the MICU he did not spike a fever or appear overtly
septic by exam or review of systems. His leukocytosis
normalized. The decision was made to leave him on his outpatient
dose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascular
physician.

#. CIRRHOSIS: This is a diagnosis that is currently undergoing
outpatient workup. He did not appear hypervolemic and this was
not likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. He
denies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing a
liver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. His
liver function was monitored while in the MICU and remained
stable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis was
performed.


TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up.
-Should f/u with PCP regarding torsemide dosing which was
decreased to every other day.  He should be evaluated for less
aggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine.
-He should follow up with his PCP and cardiology regarding
titration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.
-Warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his INR was 1.4

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**],

You were treated at [**Hospital1 18**] for low sodium and decreased kidney
function.  Your low sodium and decreased kidney function were
likely caused by a combination of not eating and drinking as
much as you used to, as well as your torsemide diuretic.  As we
gave you fluid and discontinued your torsemide, your sodium
level improved.  Please restart your torsemide, but at a lower
dose.  Take 20 mg every other day until you see your
cardiologist and primary care doctor.  You should take your next
dose on Monday [**2173-8-9**].

Your kidney function also improved with IV fluids, and is now
normal.

Please have your INR checked on Tuesday [**2173-8-10**].  You may need
adjustment in your coumadin dose.  For now, you should take 6 mg
per day as your INR is low.

Please keep the appointments listed below.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
