Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea for 6 weeks, anuric x3 days.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt's history and hospital course reviewed. Briefly, this is a
52M w/ h/o HIV who p/w 3 days of anuria and general malaise. He
had been having diarrhea for the past 6 weeks and on
presentation to the ED for his anuria, he was found to be
hypotensive to 84/60 and in ARF with Cr 5.7 (baseline 1.0). He
also complained of left-sided chest discomfort, a substernal
pressure radiating across his chest that had been ongoing for
2-3 weeks. Sepsis protocol was initiated and RSC CVL was placed.
BP improved to SBP of 100 with 4L IVF and IV heparin was started
for troponin leak of 0.11. He was transferred to the MICU.
.
While in the MICU, the patient's ARF responded well to IVF, with
his Cr decreasing to 1.8 on transfer to the floor. TnT decreased
from 0.11 to 0.02. However, TTE showed a markedly dilated RV
cavity and moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis consistent
with RV pressure/volume overload. The patient's pretest
probability for PE was considered high given his HIV status,
chest pain, and TTE results, but a V/Q scan showed low
probability. Given his post-test estimated probability of PE was
20%, he was continued on anticoagulation. Hct drop from 33.8 on
admission to 26.1 after fluid resuscitation with guaiac positive
stool, hypovolemia, likely demand ischemia, and h/o abnormal EGD
raised strong suspicion for GIB, but his Hct returned to 33.3 by
time of transfer to floor. His platelets dropped from 160 on
admission to 97, and HIT antibody test was positive [**9-25**], so he
was switched to argatroban. On the day of transfer, the pt
spiked a low-grade temperature to 100.7. He was pan-cultured but
no antibiotics were started as there was no clear infectious
source.

.
[**9-23**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The right subclavian
venous line is terminating in mid SVC. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits, and there is no consolidation or effusion.
.
[**9-23**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST. Dependent changes
are seen at the lung bases. Allowing for limitations of a
non-contrast study, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
and kidneys appear unremarkable. Again seen is a rounded
hypodensity in the right adrenal likely representing adrenal
adenoma, not significantly changed in appearance from prior
study. Visualized portions of bowel appear unremarkable. There
is no evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
Scattered lymph nodes are seenthroughout the mesentery and
retroperitoneum, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for
pathological enlargement.
.
-CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid
appear
unremarkable. Air is seen within the bladder, likely secondary
to Foley catheterization. No evidence of free air or free fluid
within the pelvis.
.
-ECHO ([**5-8**]): EF 55% , no regional wall abnormaliites, mild
pulmonary HTN.
.
-ECHO [**2192-9-24**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is minimal mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**2192-9-24**] LENIs: no DVT
.
[**2192-9-24**] V/Q scan: low probability for PE


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 y.o. HIV positive male ([**2192-9-11**]: CD4 72,
VL>100,000) with a 6 week history of diarrhea and low-grade temp
who was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and ARF,
improved after volume resuscitation.
.
# Diarrhea. Likely the patient was hypotensive and in renal
failure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating ARF. The patient
had a small amount of outpatient work-up for this, negative to
date, including: Stool C. Diff, culture and CMV viral load
undetectable. The patient was given symptomatic treatment,
including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically. He was
unable to provide a stool sample while on the floor. The patient
was given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample for
repeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial), DFA for
crytosporidium and giardia, ova & parasites, microsporidium. The
GI team was consulted on  the patient. It was their
recommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up. If
negative and diarrhea persists, the patient should have a
colonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held
(at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stent
placement. At the time of discharge, the patient's diarrhea was
well-controlled with loperamide and the patient was tolerating
fluids PO. He was encouraged to have aggressive PO fluid intake
whenever diarrhea occurs.
.
# Fevers. The patient had a low-grade (100) fever after coming
to the floor from the MICU. This may be secondary to the same
process as the diarrhea. However, the patient has poorly
controlled HIV and therefore is at risk for numerous sources.
Empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection was
found.
.
# Hypotension. Likely secondary to persistent diarrhea. The
patient was aggressively hydrated with IV NS in the MICU. He
came to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume status
for the remainder of his time in the hospital.
.
# Acute renal failure. Likely pre-renal secondary to persistent
diarrhea and volume depletion. The patient's Cr improved to
normal range after volume resuscitation.
.
# Chest pain. The patient had a CTA that was negative for PE. He
had a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demand
ischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponin
excretion in the setting of renal failure. The patient's
troponin trended downward throughout his admission and he never
showed CK elevations.
.
# CAD. No signs of acute ischemia. Troponin leak with normal CK
likely secondary to demand ischemia and ARF. The patient was
continued on ASA, plavix, beta blocker, statin. His ACEi was
held for renal failure and then restarted prior to discharge. On
echo, the patient had new mechanical dysfunction. The patient
should have outpatient p-MIBI to assess for perfusion deficits.
.
# HIV. On [**2192-9-11**], CD4 72, VL>100,000. The patient's HAART has
been held while in the MICU for renal failure. These medications
were restarted prior to discharge. The patient's PCP will
consider initiating prophylactic antibiotics as an outpatient.
.
# Anemia. Patient's baseline appears 29-30. Patient with drop in
Hct likely in part secondary to dilution. The patient had guaiac
positive stool with known abnormal colonoscopy and EGD in past
is concerning for GI bleed. The patient had multiple units of
blood transfusion while in the MICU. His Hct normalized prior to
discharge.
.
# Thrombocytopenia. The patient's platelets declined to 90 while
in the MICU and he was found to be HIT antibody positive.
Heparin products were held and the patient's platelet count
stabilized.
