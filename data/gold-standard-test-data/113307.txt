Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation
Arterial Line Placement
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with hypertension, COPD, alcoholism (unclear if active),
possible schizophrenia was admitted overnight through the ED.
His ability to relate a consistent hx is currently impaired, but
per prior notes, it seems that he was told by his neighbor to
come to the hospital as he appeared short of breath.  The
initial assessment of ED staff was that the pt was massively
fluid overloaded in the setting of CHF and non-compliance with
lasix. He was treated with Lasix IV 40mg x 2, ASA 325 and nitro,
although no chest pain and EKG . Further review of OMR reveals
that the pt is no on lasix and has no clinical hx of CHF, last
echo in [**2119**] showed preserved LVEF of 55 with only mild Ao
dilation.
.
Initial labs were notable for Na of 116 with K of 6.6 (initial
7.8 was hemolyzed) and CR 2.7; no EKG changes. LFTs elevated AST
120, ALT 50, with bili 4.5, INR 1.6, albumin 2.6. With one dose
of kayexalate, potassium has trended down to 5.3. Serial
troponins 0.04. Initial CK 700 trending down with minimal MB
fraction.
.
In terms of his mental status, his PCP saw him one month ago at
which point he was at baseline A&OX3, independent for all ADLs.
MS not in ED not clearly documented. At 8AM this morning, he
trigerred for tachypnea with RR close to 30 and worsened MS
A&Ox1 only to self. [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU. On
arrival, pt was on 2L and confused/somnolent. His audible
wheezing, tachypnea, and hypoxia improved rapidly with
albuterol. MS improved slightly when taken off supplemental O2.
ABG on room air: 7.4/35/73.

ROS: Denies any pain but unable to provide detailed ROS.

IMAGING:
[**2124-12-5**]:
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Low lung volumes and
body habitus
limits the film. Heart size is probably top normal. There is
right hilar
fullness and a prominent azygous vein suggested volume overload.
Retrocardiac opacification may be dud to suboptimal film. No
pneumothorax. Recommend convention PA and lateral with
encouraged increased respiratory effort.

[**2124-12-5**]:
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to patient motion without
evidence of
gross acute intracranial abnormality. Global diffuse atrophy

[**2124-12-5**]:
CT Chest Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited examination secondary to patient
body habitus
and lack of intravenous contrast.
1. Nodular liver suggestive of cirrhosis. Splenomegaly, likely
indicative of portal hypertension.
2. Mild intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Mild centrilobular emphysema.
4. Cholelithiasis.

[**2124-12-11**]:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of bilateral lower lobe consolidations
with air
bronchograms concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Diffuse ground
glass
opacity throughout both lungs is also identified and may
represent
superimposed pulmonary edema.
2. Interval development of mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes
which may be reactive.
3. Cirrhotic-appearing liver with splenomegaly, unchanged.
4. Interval decrease in intra-abdominal ascites.
5. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder distention.
6. Emphysematous changes.

[**2124-12-20**]:
Liver U/S:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute gallbladder process. Gallstones
again
noted.

[**2124-12-21**]:
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement of bilateral lower lobe consolidations,
with
remaining basilar consolidation and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. Cirrhotic-appearing liver with splenomegaly, unchanged.
3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites.
4. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder distention.
5. Mild fat stranding around the pancreas. Suboptimal evaluation
due to lack
of IV contrast.
6. Emphysema.
7. Low attenuation right renal lesion, most consistent with a
cyst.

Pathology:
Liver Biopsy [**2124-12-21**]:
Liver, transjugular needle core biopsy:
Markedly fragmented biopsy demonstrating:
1.  Predominantly fragments of broad, fibrous septa with mild,
mixed inflammation and focal cholangiolar proliferation,
consistent with established cirrhosis (confirmed by trichrome
stain).
2.  Scant, nodular foci of hepatic lobular parenchyma (totaling
only 20% of the total biopsy volume), with focal microvesicular
steatosis and moderate canalicular cholestasis.
3.  No central veins or native portal tracts present for
evaluation in this limited sample.
4.  Iron stain shows moderate iron deposition within
hepatocytes.
Note:  The biopsy consists almost exclusively of fibrous tissue,
consistent with established cirrhosis.  The scant lobular
parenchyma present shows only minimal, non-specific changes of
end stage liver disease. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4370**] [**Name (STitle) **] was notified of the
findings on [**2124-12-22**].


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yom with hx of HTN and COPD who initially presented
to the ED c/o SOB and noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in
ARF with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis and
synthetic dysfunction who was then admitted to the MICU for
altered mental status and eventually intubated for respiratory
distress and fluid overload.

# Acute on Chronic Liver Failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with
total body fluid overload.  He had a transaminitis which
improved and worsened several times throughout his hospital
stay.  He had synthetic dysfunction of the liver manifested by
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.  All of these findings were
consistent with cirrhosis.  A CT scan on admission confirmed a
nodular liver.  He slowly developed worsening liver failure
during his hospitalization.  A liver biopsy was done on [**2124-12-21**]
which confirmed cirrhosis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and
were negative for Hep B and Hep C.  Hep A antibody was positive.
 Hepatology was consulted and cirrhosis was thought to be [**3-6**]
history of EtOH abuse.  Tranaminitis in the hospital was unclear
but possibly [**3-6**] shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  INR
continued to rise and peaked to a level of 27 today.  Family was
involved and a family meeting was held today given his
worsensing liver failure and shock which was requiring 4
pressors.  He was made CMO by his father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], and the
patient passed away peacefully today at 225pm.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
initially intubated for respiraroty distress in the setting of
hypoxemia [**3-6**] fluid overload.  He was treated with diuretics
with minimal urine output.  Renal was consulted and he was
diagnosed with Hepatorenal syndrome and required dialysis for
fluid removal.  He was placed on HD with good removal of fluid
intitially. WBC then began to elevate and CXR was consistent
with Pneumonia so he was started on Vanco/Zosyn/Levo for
treament of hospital acquired pneumonia.  He completed a 7 day
course for his PNA.  He self extubated while in the MICU and was
then reintubated for respiratory distress.  He then developed
VAP while intubated and was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro.

# Shock:  Patient had acute decompensated liver failure along
with pneumonia which were likely contributing to his shock.
Broead infectious workup was done and workup remained negative
while in the hospital.  He was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro
for treatment of HAP.  Flagyl was started out of concern for
c.diff although c.diff cultures remained negative.

# Altered mental status: Thought to be secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy.  Initially improved with lactulose.  Patient was
treated with lactulose and rifaximin throughout his stay.

# Acute Renal Failure:  Thought to be [**3-6**] hepatorenal syndrome.
He developed anuria while in the hospital.  Given his fluid
overload and pulmonary edema requiring intubation, renal was
consulted and a dialysis line was placed.  He was placed on HD
for removal of fluid.  This was changed to CVVH when he became
hypotensive to allow for gentle fluid removal.

# Hyponatremia: Thought to be [**3-6**] fluid overload in the setting
of cirrhosis

# Coagulopathy: Likley [**3-6**] cirrhosis and liver failure
