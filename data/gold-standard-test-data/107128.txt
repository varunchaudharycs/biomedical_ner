Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Benzodiazepines / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Swan-ganz catheter placement
Blood component transfusions


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 88 yo male h/o CAD, MI, AAA (s/p repair, no leak)
recent AICD for syncopal episode NOS ([**11-11**]), severe
cardiomyopathy EF 10%, who originally presented to OSH with
epigastric pain found to be hypotensive there to 60s systolic.
He was then intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure with ABG
7.26/52/41 (was DNR/DNI). He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] CCU. A
CTA was done to rule out AAA and did not show any leak but
aneurysm of 6.5 cm and stable.
.
Pt was treated for his shock which was of unclear etiology. He
was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin on [**2120-12-13**] and vancomycin
was d/cd as sputum from [**2120-12-14**] grew GNR not further speciated.
There was not found to be any other source of infection. In the
CCU, pressors were weaned off [**2120-12-17**]. Pt was started on
steroids on [**2120-12-14**] for inappropriate cortisol stimulation test
though it appears not drawn correctly.
.
Called by floor team today as pt with "[**10-15**]" abdominal pain
that was sharp and radiated to his back x 10 minutes. Their exam
revealed pain out of proportion to it and concern was for
mesenteric ischemia. Lactate on a VBG was noted to be up to 2.4
but repeat with ABG is 1.7. Pt says that he vomited x 1 today,
did not notice the color. +mild sob. +dry cough that started
today. +abdominal pain [**9-15**] when I saw pt.

Pertinent Results:
CTA [**2120-12-13**]-IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence for aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus.
2.  6.5-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with evidence of
graft repair distally.  No evidence of aneurysm rupture or leak.

3.  Pulmonary vascular congestion, intra-abdominal ascites,
periportal edema, and anasarca suggest congestive heart failure
versus volume overload or both.
4.  Cardiomegaly.
5.  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis with small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
Echo [**2120-12-13**]-The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, EF 10-15%. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR AP (not official read)- enlarged heart s/p sternotomy wires.
There are b/l pleural effusions. ? left retrocardiac opacity.
.
CTA wet read from radiology: SMA is patent. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] cant see [**2-8**]
graft. No post-ischemic changes. Free fluid in abdomen and
anasarca, all unchanged. No change from prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
In Brief, the patient is an 88 year old man with severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement, atrial flutter, CAD,
chronic kidney disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory
failure and shock which was stablized.  His course was further
complicated by acute abdomial pain, psoas muscle hematoma, upper
GI bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, heparin induced
thrombocytopenia with upper extremity DVT, intermittent hypoxia,
and urinary retention.
.

1) Shock - Patient intially presented in shock requiring
vasopressors.  Cardiac index was normal with decreased SVR which
were not consistent with cardiogenic shock. The likely cause of
was distributive/septic shock of unclear source of infection.
He completed a full course of empiric antibiotics.  He completed
7 days of hydrocortisone/fludrocort for sub-optimal response to
ACTH.  BP stablized by time of discharge.
.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented in
hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to CHF,
hypoventilation and decreased mental status.  He was intubated
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was weaned from the ventilator
successfully.  He did have intermittent hypoxia largely
secondary to pulmonary edema from inadequate diuresis.  He was
stabilized on standing twice daily lasix. He was started on
BiPaP at night for hypoventilation.
.
3) Abdominal pain - During the hospital stay he developed acute
severe epigastric pain.  He was transfered to the MICU for
concern for mesenteric ischemia.  An abominal CTA was negative
for this.  A surgery consult was obtained and recommended no
surgical intervention.  The pain resolved without specific
intervention. He was subsequently found to have an psoas muscle
hematoma and required several blood transfusions with
appropriate response in his hematocrit.

4) Cardiovascular:
a. CAD- history of MI s/p CABG. will continue ASA, simvastatin,
beta-blocker.
.
b. Pump- Severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10-15% s/p
BiV-ICD placement. No evidence of cardiogenic shock upon initial
presenation as C.I. was normal.  Medically managed CHF with
ACEi, beta-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide.
.
c. rhythm- [**Hospital1 **]-V paced with underlying rhythm is atrial
flutter/fibrillation. Started on amiodarone for maintenance of
sinus rhythm to maximize likelihood of atrial kick. Also,
amiodarone to decrease in-appropriate shocks from ICD.

5) Upper GI bleed - The patient did develop guaiac positive
stools in the setting of anticoagulation for the atrial
fibrillation. The hematocrit drop was largely due to the psoas
hematoma as above.  The patient refused EGD.  If the patient
develops recurrent melenotic stools he could be referred to GI
for endoscopy.  He will continue on a PPI.
.
6)Acute on Chronic Renal failure - Initial creatinine down from
admission to peak 2.5 this was likely from pre-renal secondary
to shock state; no evidence of ATN. By time of discharge, the
creatinine had resolved to baseline.
.
7) Anemia-  In addition the the acute blood loss anemia as
described above.  The patient has a chronic microcytic anemia.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease
(labs drawn before blood transfusions were given).  Also with
regard to the significant microcytosis and his Italian
extraction, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed to evaluate
for thallasemia.  These results were pending at time of
discharge.
.
8) Thrombocytopenia - HIT type II. PF4 positive on [**2120-12-27**],
Platelets stable at around 70K with subsequent recovery to
greater than 150K. He did have a left upper extremity venous
clot although the developement of this was after his platelets
had stabilized.  Started argatroban on [**2120-12-27**] with transition
to coumadin.  He continued on argatroban until his INR on
combined anti-coagulation was >4. At which time he was
maintained on coumadin alone.
.
9) Urinary retention: - The patient has no prior history of
urinary retention, nocturia, frequency or related BPH symptoms.
During one attempt at removing the foley catheter he had
decreased urine output with a large volume detected on bladder
scan.  The foley was replaced.  He was started on finasteride,
not wanting to use an alpha-blocker that would likely cause
hypotension when added to his extensive cardiac regimen.  The
catheter was left in at discharge.  This should be removed in
[**2-9**] days followed by confirmation that the patient can urinate.
.
10) Code Status: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient and HCP.
.
11) Dispo: the patient was discharged to rehab

Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated for respiratory distress, and very low
blood blood pressure.  These resolved with time, antibiotics,
and close management of your chronic heart disease.  Your course
was complicated by a bleed into a hip muscle, a reaction to a
medication called heparin, and difficulty urinating.  These were
all stablized over the course of the hospital stay.

Please take the medications as prescribed.

Please make and attend your recommended follow-up appointments.

If you develop any concerning symptom particularly chest pain,
shortness of breath, bloody or tarry stools please seek medical
attention.

Followup Instructions:
Please contact your primary doctor Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58623**] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 58624**] to be seen within the next 1-2 weeks.

In the meantime you will be evaluated by the physicians at the
rehab facility.
