Imaging:
CTA Head [**6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above with a
multilobulated left ICA terminus aneurysm measuring
approximately 4 x 6 mm as the presumed source. Traditional
angiography pending.

Cardiac Echo [**6-4**]:
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20--25%). There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of mid-to-apical myocardioum.
Basal and Apex areas are spared. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The left atrium is normal in
size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF
20-25 %) with regionality; akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with
sparing of the apex. Right ventricular systolic function and
size is normal. Moderate to severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.


CT C-spine [**6-4**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No acute traumatic injury seen in the cervical spine.
2. Blood in the basal cisterns tracking inferiorly and
anteriorly along the brainstem and upper spinal cord. Thecal sac
contents are not adequately assessed on the present study. MR
can be considered if there is concern based on neurological
examination.
3. Airspace consolidation in the posterior lung apices with
smooth septal
thickening. Findings along with chest radiograph likely
represents some
pulmonary edema, although aspiration cannot be excluded.

CT Head [**6-5**]:
FINDINGS: The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage appears stable in
extent.
Overall, ventricular size has further decreased, compared to the
prior study. The ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the
region of the third ventricle remains present. There has been
further interval progression of bilateral regions of
hypoattenuation involving the medial inferior frontal lobes.
There is no associated parenchymal hemorrhage. There is no shift
of normally midline structures. The streak artifact produced by
left distal internal carotid artery coils obscures evaluation in
area. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Trace
intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly in the
occipital horns as well as small amount in the third ventricle
are stable. The mastoid air cells and imaged paranasal sinuses
remain well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in ventricular size, compared to the prior
study.
2. Further evolution of bifrontal hypoattenuation, which may
represent
infarcts rather than non-hemorrhagic contusion, given the
progression. No
parenchymal hemorrhage. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] head can be considered, if
necessary to
assess extent and vessels as recommended earlier.
3. Stable extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CXR [**2165-6-5**]
Final Report
INDICATION: 52-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage,
dilated
cardiomyopathy. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.

Single AP chest radiographs compared to 13 hours prior shows no
change. ET
tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular
central venous
catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach, the
sidehole slightly below the gastroesophageal junction. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again seen are bilateral
perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, not
significantly changed from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Compared to prior exam from [**2165-6-5**], there is
no change in the extent of pulmonary edema.



Cardiac Echo : [**2165-6-11**]
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. There is no mass/thrombus in the right
ventricle. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2165-6-4**], left ventricular systolic function has improved.
Akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex has
resolved.

Final Report
PORTABLE CHEST [**2165-6-19**]:

COMPARISON: Study of earlier the same date.

INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.

FINDINGS: Feeding tube tip is directed cephalad in region of
gastroduodenal
junction. Appearance of the chest is similar to the recent
radiograph of
about 2 hours earlier except for minimal improved aeration in
the left
retrocardiac region.

[**2165-6-25**] 12:25 PM CT
HEAD CT: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without
IV contrast
administration.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2165-6-23**].

FINDINGS: There is a tract of hypodensity extending along the
course of the prior right frontal approach ventriculostomy
catheter (2:13). There is no hyperdensity along this tract to
suggest the presence of hemorrhage. The ventricles are unchanged
in size and configuration. There is streak artifact from a left
ICA aneurysm coil. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains
well preserved. There is no evidence of prior subarachnoid
hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is hypodensity in the territory of the left MCA related to
prior infarct (2:15), which appear stable without evidence for
hemorrhagic transformation. There is a right frontal burr hole
otherwise osseous structures are intact. The paranasal sinuses,
ethmoid, and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Post-right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter removal
without
evidence for hemorrhage. Stable ventricular size.

2. Unchanged appearance to region of infarction in the left MCA
distribution without hemorrhagic transformation.


SAT [**2165-6-22**] 12:08 PM
Final Report
INDICATION: 52-year-old female with transaminitis and fevers.
Evaluate right
upper quadrant.

COMPARISON: CT chest dated [**2165-6-7**].

FINDINGS: The liver is normal in contour and echotexture. There
is a single 1.2-cm cyst identified in the periphery of the right
dome. There are no other focal liver lesions identified. There
is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The common bile duct measures 5 mm. The gallbladder is
unremarkable, with no wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid.
There are no stones or sludge identified within the gallbladder.
There is normal antegrade flow identified in the main portal
vein. The spleen measures 8.7 cm and is normal in appearance.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen. Small right pleural
effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. 1.2-cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver, as appreciated on
CT of the
chest dated [**2165-6-7**]. Liver is otherwise unremarkable.

2. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for acute cholecystitis. No
cholelithiasis.





Brief Hospital Course:
52F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH following a
witnessed syncopal episode. Head CT performed showing diffuse
SAH. CTA of head also performed with preliminarily identified an
aneurysm at the left ICA bifurcation. She was loaded with
dilantin, and started on nimodipine, and emergent bedside
external ventricular drain was placed. She also had a cardiac
echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced
cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed
significantly depressed cardic function. She was placed on a
[**Last Name (un) 18821**] monitor to more closely monitor for this. She had an
angiogram done on [**6-4**], when the left distal ICA aneurysm was
coiled. She then returned to the ICU postoperatively.
On [**6-5**](overnight) she had a ICP elevation to 50 and the drain
was promplty dropped to 10cm, and ICP normalized. Emergent head
CT was done which showed likely evolving brifrontal
hypoattenuations/possible stroke. She again returned to angio on
[**6-6**] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new CT
finding.The patient was febrile with a Tmax 101.6 and was pan
cultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were both
neagtive. On [**6-6**] The Dobutamine intravenous drip was off,
vasopressors Levophed and neo cont.  The Nimodipine cut in [**12-21**]
to maintain goal blood pressures. The patient was brought to
angio, there was no significant spasm and given 5mg
verapamil-aneurysm stable.  Blood cultures were found to be
negative.  The sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.On
[**6-7**]: The patient had an acute PaO2 decrease to 50%.  There was
a concern for Pulmonary embolusE.  The CTA of the Chest was not
consistent with Pulmonary embolus. The CT Head was unchanged.
The patient was moniotored for possible Central Diabetes
Insipidus. The urine and sputum cultures were both negative. On
[**6-8**],  The patient was pan-cultured for a fever to 102. A head
CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for
increased ICPs. A CTA was performed which was consistent with a
slight decrease in intercranial vasospasm. On [**6-9**], The patient
required 3 doses of mannitol for sustained ICP levels of 23.
There were no changes in the patients mental status with these
ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following
commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity
moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper
extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and
tracked with her eyes. On [**6-10**], The patient was back on a
dobutamine gtt continuously to maintain a goal blood pressure,
The patient had a TEE which was consistent with Ejection F of
20%. The LENIS were negative for deep vein thrombosis, The CSF
and sputum cultures were negative. On [**6-11**], The patient
underwent an angio which was consistent with mild to mod
vasospasm.  She recieved 2 doses of verapamil.Nimodipine at 15mg
every 2 hours was restarted. On [**6-12**], The patient was bolused
with dilantin 300mg for a 7.9 level.  The Head CT was repeated
and was stable. The patient was extubated and stopped nimodpine
for systolic blood pressure in 60's.The goal MAP > 100 and
dobutamine was restarted.

[**6-14**] CT shows:new stroke in the posterior left MCA distribution
CTA shows diffuse, severe vasospasm involving the bilateral MCAs
(left worse than right)the following day she underwent a
cerebral angiogram which showed Mild to moderate spasm Left A1,2
and M1,2 segments though her exam seemed to slightly improve
with brisk localization on LUE and localization on RUE though
not as brisk as left. She had some intermittent eye opening. A
stroke neurology consult was obtained and they agreed with our
continued HHH management and requested starting a Statin.

On [**6-17**], she was again febrile, and pan cultured. CVL
access was changed and catheter tip sent. OR was cancelled for
the day for her temperature, and possibly to re-attempt [**6-19**] or
[**6-20**] if afebrile and no positive cultures. Positive blood cx from
arterial line and appearance of axillary A line, concerned for
line infection and she was treated for line associated
bacteremia for 7 day course.  PEG placed by surgery team on
[**2165-6-26**] without event.   Meds and diet were advanced through PEG
as recommended without issue.

On discharge her neurological exam she preferred her eyes closed
would open to voice, questionable following commands  with left
side. She is essentially plegic on right side but will withdraw
both arm and leg to pain. Her pupils are 4mm and reactive, her
incision are well healed. She was tolerating her tube feeds
without difficulty. Speech and swallow recommends video swallow
before initiating any oral feeds.
