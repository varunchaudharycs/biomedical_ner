Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy with clips, epinephrine injection, and Bicap thermal
therapy to site of bleeding gastric ulcers.

History of Present Illness:
84M with lymphoma s/p CHOP last week, h/o GIB, dilated CMP, who
originally presented from home with hematemesis x2, after taking
high dose prednisone during chemotherapy as well as Bufrin for
arthritis. Patient denied melena, abdominal pain, hematochezia,
chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or chest pain.
Patient has had UGIB in past with NSAID use. Patient came to ED,
with VS 96.8, 100, 119/65, 18, 100%RA and A and O times 3.
At home, patient is functional in his ADLs, grocery shopping and
driving on his own, and taking care of his wife with [**Name (NI) 2481**]
disease. Patient is very noncompliant at home.

He was given PPI, received NGT lavage, which did not clear after
1L, and patient was fluid resuscitated prior to transfer to the
MICU for emergent endoscopy. In the MICU, patient had endoscopy
showing multiple gastric ulcers, which were clipped, injected
with epinephrine, and Bicapped. He remained hemodynamically
stable. Patient was also found to have an evolving STEMI, with
isolated ST elevation in V3, as well as CE with peak troponin of
1.48 on [**2188-2-6**]. Patient remained chest pain free. Cardiology
was consulted, and patient was medically managed with a beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor, and advised to follow up for an
outpatient stress test. Patient was taken off his home digoxin
and amlodipine. Patient is transferred to OMED.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
mid to distal
anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis and basal to mid

inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis akinesis. The apex is not
fully visualized
but appears hypokinetic/akinetic. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is
seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-21**],
left
ventricular systolic function is now significantly worse with
new anteroseptal
and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis.
.
EKG [**2188-2-6**]:
Atrial fibrillation
Ventricular premature complex
Modest nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities
Anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate - possible
acute/recent/in
evolution
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
Since previous tracing of [**2188-2-5**], further ST-T wave
abnormalities present
.
Endoscopy:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: A sliding small size hiatal hernia was seen.
 Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa suggestive of Barrett's
Esophagus was found. Biopsy not performed due to bleeding.
Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions Multiple ulcers were found in the antrum and
stomach body. A large 3-4 cm cratered ulcer with a necrotic
center and adherent clot on the incisura was seen. There was a
pulsating vessel seen after the clot was removed. Two resolution
clips were applied to the vessel with persistent oozing. 9cc of
1:10,000 epinephrine was injected with successful hemostasis.
Bicap thermal therapy was then applied to the area at the
setting of 28. No bleeding was seen at the completion of
therapy. Much of the body and fundus was not well-visualized due
to blood and clot obscuring the view.
Duodenum:
 Other lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb.
Other
findings: An opening that is either a diverticulum or accessory
duct was seen in the second portion of the duodenum.
Impression: Ulcers in the antrum and stomach body
Lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb.
Small hiatal hernia
An opening that is either a diverticulum or accessory duct was
seen in the second portion of the duodenum.
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo male with PMHx sx for lymphoma, upper GIB, cardiomyopathy,
who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple gastric
ulcers seen on endoscopy, likely secondary to NSAID use and
recent high dose prednisone with CHOP therapy for lymphoma.
Patient was also found to have a silent STEMI, with V3 elevation
and elevated CE.
.
Upper GI bleed: Patient's UGI bleed was likely [**1-24**] NSAID use
combined with recent prednisone for CHOP. Patient was transfused
several units while in the MICU for hematocrit drop from 29.9 to
20.8 on presentation. Patient had an NG lavage performed, which
did not clear after 1000cc NS were infused. An emergent upper
endoscopy demonstrated ulcers in the antrum and stomach body,
lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb, and mucosa suggestive
of Barrett's esophagus. Patient's ulcers were clipped, injected
with epinephrine, and had thermal therapy which stopped the
bleeding. Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for
increased bleeding.
On transfer to OMED, patient was hemodynamically stable, but
then began to have drop in hematocrit. He received three units
of blood, without an appropriate increase in hematocrit. He
remained guaiac positive, had two large bore pIVs for access,
and continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole. He had serial hematocrits
checked, and was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge.
Patient was scheduled for outpatient endoscopy to reassess the
ulcers, and for biopsy of the lymphoid hyperplasia. Patient was
advised to avoid all NSAIDs. He will have serial hematocrits
checked by home VNA.
.
STEMI: Patient was admitted with initial STE in V3, but with a
progressive rise in cardiac enzymes. He was noted to have
evolving ST changes since admission with peak troponin, and was
diagnosed as having a STEMI. A cardiology consult was obtained,
and recommended stopping patient's amlodipine and digoxin, and
starting atorvastatin, lisinopril and metoprolol, which were
started when patient was hemodynamically stable from a GI bleed
perspective. Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, and he was
found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 2.24,
with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB. Cardiology was
reconsulted, and felt that elevation in troponin was not an
indication for cardiac catheterization, and opted for medical
management. Patient was not placed on heparin due to bleeding
risk. He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due
to bleeding risk, and due to concern for poor compliance as an
outpatient.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed global
hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from
stunned myocardium. He will need to have follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist. He remained on telemetry with no
events. He will need a stress test as an outpatient. He remained
chest pain free through his admission.
.
Lymphoma: Patient's lymphoma was stable. He received one dose of
neupogen as an inpatient, but had a leukocytosis. He will be
seen in [**Hospital 20722**] clinic for consideration of further
chemotherapy. Patient will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5565**]
as an outpatient.
.
Patient remained full code. His diet was advanced as tolerated.
His electrolytes were monitored carefully and repleted.
Communication was with patient, and son Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2578**] [**Known lastname **]. C:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21950**] H: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21951**]. Patient was seen by physical and
occupational therapy. He will be seen by physical therapy at
home for services.
