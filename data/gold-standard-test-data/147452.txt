History of Present Illness:
73 M with h/o AF not on anticoaggulation presented to PCP with
constant chest pressure, worse with eating or exertion.  Gets
minimal relief from TUMS.  His PCP referred him for ETT which
was stopped after 5 min due to chest pain.  MIBI revealed
inferior ischemia, posterior wall infarct, and LVEF 47% with
inferobasal hypokinesis.   He had catheterization on [**2152-8-14**]
which showed severe 3VD (occluded RCA, 90% LCx, 80% LAD).  He
has had intermittent CP, especially at night, and a nitro drip
was started.  He was set to get CABG today ([**2152-8-18**])with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**], but his creatinine rose to 1.8 over baseline of 1.2.
CABG was delayed to allow pt's renal function to improve. Pain
free currently.

FINAL REPORT


PORTABLE CHEST 10:11 A.M. ON [**8-23**].

INDICATION: Status post CABG and ASD closure. Evaluate for
pneumothorax,
status post chest tube removal.

FINDINGS: Compared with 9/19, ETT, NGT, mediastinal and left
chest tubes have
been removed. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter remains at the
level of the
right main PA. No pneumothorax identified.

Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

general anesthesia throughout the procedure. Results were

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest by color flow Doppler and
with agitated saline contrast during a modified Valsalva
maneuver.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild to
[**Month/Day (2) 1192**] ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
[**Month/Day (2) 1192**]([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric and directed posteriorly. MR
increased to the [**Month/Day (2) 1192**] range with increasing of SBP to 160mm
Hg.

POSTBYPASS
1. Biventricular systolic function remains normal.
2. The AI remains unchanged.
3. No flow is seen across the interatrial septum by color flow
doppler interrogation. Bubble study with valsalva is negative.
4. MR [**First Name (Titles) 9807**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] on coming off CPB, subsequently
improved to mild - [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**].
5. Aorta is intact post decannulation
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2152-8-14**] for cardiac cath and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
for cabg/Maze. Surgery delayed for rising creatinine and plavix
washout, and right femoral pseudoaneurysm post-cath.Renal
consult done. Ultimately underwent cabg x4/cryo Maze/ ASD
closure/ ligation of left atrial appendage on [**8-21**]. Transferred
to the CSRU in stable condition on neosynephrine and propofol
drips. Transfused for postop anemia and on
epinephrine,amiodarone, neo and insulin drips. TEE/cardioversion
done for Afib. Extubated later that morning. Epinephrine weaned
off on POD #2 and transferred to the floor on POD #3 to begin
increasing his activity level.  Central line and foley removed
on POD #3.Pacing wires removed without incident on POD #4. Some
serosanguineous sternal drainage started on Friday and was
observed with abx started on POD #6 and discontinued on POD #7.
Will monitor with a wound check in 4 days here on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2.
Creatinine 1.5 (roughly baseline) on POD #7 and cleared for
discharge to home with services.Patient to make all follow-up
appts. as per discharge instructions.
