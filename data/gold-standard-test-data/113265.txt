                            **FINAL REPORT [**2135-8-18**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2135-8-18**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

IMAGING:
MRI Spine [**7-3**]:
1. Cervical anterior epidural collection, with severe narrowing
of the thecal sac from C2 through C5, without evidence of spinal
cord edema. Sagittal post-contrast images suggest that this
collection contains fluid at the level of C2, which would
indicate an abscess rather than a phlegmon. However, axial
post-contrast images suggest that the central hypoenhancing
portion of the collection at C2 may not be fully liquefied, or
that the fluid may be highly viscous.
2. Anterior epidural collection from T11 through the upper
sacrum,
compressing the thecal sac and crowding the cauda equina. This
collection
appears to contain fluid from T12 through L3, indicative of an
abscess rather than a phlegmon.
3. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
4. Bilateral posterior paravertebral muscle phlegmon at the
level of L4-5
with a possible 5 mm abscess on the right. Contrast enhancement
surrounding the L4-5 facet joints may represent inflammation
secondary to the severe degenerative facet arthropathy, but
septic facet arthropathy cannot be excluded

Echo [**7-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild mitral leaflet
thickening but without discrete vegetation or pathologic flow.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left
ventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional
systolic function

MRI Spine [**7-4**]:
1. Cervical region: No STIR signal abnormality in the cord. No
evidence of
cord compression. Expected post-op changes.
2. Lumbar region: Small epidural signal abnormality, could
represent residual abscess collection from debridement or
post-surgical changes.

XRAY-Knee
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate-sized knee joint effusion.

CTA [**7-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subtotal lower lobe
collapse.
Evidence of loculated pleural effusions tracking up in the right
upper lateral pleural space.
3. Multiple lung nodules likely infectious in this cl
inical setting. Follow-
up to resolution is recommended
4. No pneumothorax.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**8-12**]
Significant increase in volume of the epidural fluid
collection/abscess
extending from the uppermost C1 epidural space to the inferior
aspect of the study at L1, largest at the upper cervical spine
where it measures
approximately 1 cm in greatest thickness. The patient is status
post cervical laminectomy from approximately C2-C6 but the
epidural collection displaces the cervical cord posteriorly and
the cervical cord appears compressed against the posterior ring
of C1. There is increased signal within the cervical cord from
the medulla to C3.
2. The epidural collection/abscess within the thoracic spine
mildly
displaces the thoracic cord without evidence of cord signal
abnormality.

CT-Thoracentesis (drainage) [**7-13**]
IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis
yielding 270 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the right pleural
cavity. An 8 French
pigtail catheter was placed within the pleural cavity and is
currently
attached to waterseal. Samples were sent for microbiology and
chemistry per the ordering team's request.

MR C/T/L-Spine [**7-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. New soft tissue paraspinal pockets of fluid collection are
seen in the
lumbar region since the examination of [**2135-7-2**] and [**2135-7-4**],
visualized in the lower lumbar region involving the psoas
muscles and the erector spinae muscles. The largest collection
in the right erector spinae muscle is approximately 3 cm and the
largest collection in the right psoas muscle is approximately 2
cm. Additional left psoas muscle fluid pocket measures 2.8 cm.
Smaller foci are also visualized.
2. Lumbar epidural fluid collection ventral and dorsal to the
thecal sac in the lower lumbar region may be slightly smaller
compared to [**2135-7-2**].
3. Epidural collection in the cervical region extending from C2
inferiorly is not significantly changed since the MRI of
[**2135-7-14**]. Minimal indentation on the spinal cord in cervical
region is unchanged. Postoperative changes and laminectomies are
seen in this region.
4. Thoracic epidural collection has not changed and there is no
cord
compression in thoracic region.
4. Laminectomies are seen in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar
region. Thin
rim of epidural collection again seen in the thoracic region
which is
unchanged. No cord compression is identified in the thoracic
region.

CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**7-26**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Overall, stable appearance of multiple small fluid collection
seen in the paraspinal muscles along with the erector spinae and
psoas muscles, as
described above. No new intraabdominal or intrapelvic
collections identified.
2. Stable bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar airspace
disease.
3. Stable appearance of mediastinal and bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy.

U/S Abdomen [**7-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis with edematous and thick walled but contracted
gallbladder. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Gallbladder wall thickening and edema may be caused by multiple
factors such as liver disease and hypoalbuminemia, and clinical
correlation is recommended.
2. Splenomegaly.

CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple soft tissue abscesses appear similar to prior
examination with
erector spinae abscess on the right, left iliopsoas abscess, and
fluid pockets overlying the lower lumbar spine spinous
processes.
2. Left posterior rotator cuff region possible new abscess, not
well seen on prior studies.
3. Bilateral basal pulmonary volume loss and consolidation,
similar to prior examination in lesion addition to bilateral
pleural effusions, more pronounced and somewhat loculated on the
right but similar to prior study.
4. Nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening. Cholecystitis is not
excluded,
although the appearance is stable compared to prior examination
and has been previously evaluated with ultrasound.
5. Nonspecific lesion in the right renal upper pole. This was
not well seen on prior examination. If there is clinical
suspicion for renal abscess, targeted ultrasound could be
performed to further assess.
6. Left proximal thigh abscess, incompletely assessed but
similar to prior
study allowing for difference in technique.
7. Splenomegaly.

MRI C-Spine [**8-6**]
IMPRESSION: Again, epidural enhancement and abscesses identified
in the
anterior cervical region. As described above, the fluid
collection around
C2-C3 level appears slightly increased in thickness, but the
differences in measurements are small and this could also be due
to partial volume averaging,
but continued followup is recommended. Otherwise, the
examination is stable

MRI T-Spine [**8-6**]
IMPRESSION: Overall stable appearance of the thoracic spine
compared to the previous MRI of [**2135-7-21**]. Again, lower thoracic
and upper lumbar
laminectomies and epidural enhancement is seen in the thoracic
region without epidural abscess.

CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**8-9**]):
with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, look for possible
underlying
abdominal abscess.

COMPARISON: CT torso from [**2135-8-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT of the abdomen. The patient not
received any
oral or IV contrast.

FINDINGS: Of note, evaluation of abdominal organs is limited
without any
intravenous or oral contrast administered. Once again, there are
bilateral
pleural effusions with overlying collapse/consolidation that has
slightly
improved from previous study. Once again, the right is
significantly greater than the left and appears loculated. A
nodular density previously seen in the right middle lobe is not
visualized in the current study.

CT ABDOMEN W/O Contrast:
There is no focal liver lesion seen. There is evidence of a
large stone
within the gallbladder; however, there are no signs of
gallbladder wall
thickening or other associated signs to suggest inflammation or
infection. The spleen is enlarged. There is no focal splenic
lesion or abscess seen.
Pancreas appears normal. Adrenals appear normal. The kidney is
normal in
appearance. Right kidney appears normal in appearance. The small
area of
hypoattenuation seen in the left kidney on the previous study
was not
appreciated on the current exam. Small periaortic and portacaval
lymph nodes are again seen, however, they do not meet CT
criteria for lymphadenopathy. There is no bowel obstruction. The
appendix is normal. There is no significant mesenteric
lymphadenopathy or fluid collection seen.

CT PELVIS W/O contrast: Once again seen is a low-attenuation
fluid collection in the left iliopsoas muscle, extending from
the lower lumbar-upper pelvic regions along the psoas. This
collection appears unchanged, both in size and in character and
further characterization is limited without contrast. Once again
seen are the small areas of low attenuation, representing fluid
in the proximal thigh as well as stranding in the left greater
trochanter. This appears unchanged from the previous study of
[**2135-8-1**]. There is no epidural abscess seen in the
thoracic region.

The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.

3D reconstructions, coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
essential in
delineating the anatomy and pathology.

BONES: There is no osseous destruction seen. As mentioned,
evidence of priorlaminectomies at the lower thoracic spine and
upper lumbar spine are seen.There are no epidural collections
suggestive of epidural abscess in the lumbaror visualized
thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left iliopsoas abscess
2. Slight interval decrease in bilateral basal pulmonary volume
loss and
consolidation and pleural effusions.
3. Large gallstone within the gallbladder without sign of
gallbladder
inflammation.
4. Unchanged fluid collection in the left proximal thigh
compared to prior.
5. This study was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4:30 p.m.
on [**2135-8-9**].
.
Unilateral upper extremity venous ultrasound. ([**8-17**])
COMPARISON: Upper extremity venous ultrasound [**2135-7-11**].
FINDINGS: Color and grayscale son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral subclavian
and
left-sided internal jugular, basilic, brachial and cephalic
vessels were
evaluated. Evaluated vessels demonstrated normal flow,
compressibility and
augmentation. There is a PICC line in the basilic. There is
duplication of
the brachial vessels.
IMPRESSION: PICC in the basilic vein but no DVT.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with no significant past medical
history who initially presented with back pain, urinary
retention on [**7-3**], found to have multiple epidural abscesses s/p
multiple surgical debridements with hospital course complicated
by episodes of flash pulmonary/respiratory compromise requiring
intubation and febrile neutropenia secondary to lasix and
vancomycin administration.
.
# Bacteremia/Abscesses/Antibiotic therapy
.
Patient initially presented with back pain, associated urinary
retention and LE weakness. Admission imaging positive for
cervical and lumbar epidural abscesses (though patient with no
known risk factors). She was empirically started on
vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin. She underwent C2-C6/T12-L2
bilateral laminectomies with insertion of 4 drains on [**2135-7-3**].
She subsequently developed a septic right knee and returned to
the OR on [**2135-7-4**] for right knee washout. Regarding further
initial infectious work-up at that time: a TEE was obtained
which showed no vegetations; CT head without evidence of
intracranial abscess.
.
On [**2135-7-6**], antibiotic coverage was narrowed to nafcillin when
cultures from abscesses, right knee, and blood grew MSSA.
However, due to signs and symptoms of leukocytosis, hypoxia
there was concern for hospital acquired pneumonia and antibiotic
coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and
ciprofloxacin on [**7-10**]. Patient remained febrile. Surveillance
imaging obtained on [**7-12**] which demonstrated increased epidural
collection within anterior cervical epidural space and
displacement of the cervical cord. The patient returned to the
OR on [**7-13**] for abscess decompression and evacuation and fusion
of C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6. After reviewing microbial date with all
cultures + MSSA, her antibiotic coverage was again narrowed to
nafcillin.
.
Patient had been doing well with normalized temperature and WBC
however four days after starting nafcillin, developed a
abdominal rash. Derm was consulted, biopsies were taken which
were c/w drug rash secondary to nafcillin. Nafcillin was
subsequently discontinued and replaced by IV vancomycin.
.
Repeat MR spine with new paraspinal fluid collections, and mild
epidural fluid collection throughout the spine. Due to concern
for continued infection cefepime was added to antibiotic
regimen. On [**7-25**], the patient underwent paraspinal abscess
drainage by interventional radiology. Follow-up CT torso was
obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc;
finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was
discontinued. On [**8-5**], her C-collar was removed. Surveilance MR
C/T-Spine on [**8-6**] showed stable epidural enhancement and
abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region, thoracic
region without epidural abscess. CT scan on [**8-9**] demonstrated
left iliopsoas abscess/phlegmen and left thigh fluid collection;
both of which were too small to be drained by IR.
.
Unfortunately side effects necessitated further antibiotic
adjustment. CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression
to neutropenia [**8-8**].  Out of concern that vancomycin could be
contributing to decreasing counts, vanc d/c'ed  and IV
daptomycin started. Per ID will plan to treat MSSA
bacteremia/abscesses with IV daptomycin to total of 6-8wk
course. At time of discharge utility of repeat imaging
discussed. Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into
antibiotic treatment.
.
# Febrile Neutropenia
.
Patient's WBC count began to slowly decline on [**8-5**] with
progression to neutropenia on [**8-8**]. Neutropenia was felt
secondary to medication effect; subsequently omeprazole,
furosemide, vancomycin and seroquel were discontinued.
Hematology was consulted, and felt that furosemide or vancomycin
were likely offending agents. Antibiotic coverage altered on
[**8-8**]: vancomycin discontinued and daptomycin started for
treatment of MSSA. On [**8-9**] she was febrile 102.6 and meropenem
started for treatment of neutropenic fever. GCSF initiated.
After administration of GCSF counts slowly became to rise and
fevers abated. GCSF was stopped on [**8-14**] when ANC>1000 for more
than 48hrs.
.
Respiratory Distress
.
On admission patient found to be tachypnic. LENIs negative. On
[**7-8**], developed worsening tachypnea and hypoxemia (95% on 4L by
nasal canula). The patient diureased 500ml on IV Lasix and
improved slightly. CTA ruled out PE, however showed evidence of
bilateral loculated pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules.
Cardiac enzymes negative. Pro-BNP 2777 on [**7-8**]. Estimated EF by
TEE was >55%; 2 repeat echos without evidence of valvular
pathology. In MICU, IV Lasix and morphine lessened respiratory
distress. On [**7-10**], transferred to the floor; latered became
hypoxic and was transfered back to the MICU and started on
BiPAP. Pleural effusion studies suggested parapneumonic
effusion. Patient intubated and extubated several time while in
MICU. On [**7-16**], the patient was again extubated. She developed
hypertension to 180 SBP and respiratory distress secondary to
pulm edema, which responded to lasix and labetolol. On [**7-19**], she
was comfortable oxygenating with only nasal cannula. She was
electively intubated on [**7-25**] for paraspinal abscess drainage and
extubated post-procedure. Unfortunately, again developed
worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring
reintubation on [**7-27**].  She was gently diuresed, in an effort to
decrease the work of breathing. On [**8-3**] she was succesfully
extubated, satting well on face mask. On [**8-5**] she was weaned to
NC. CT on [**8-9**] showed improvement in pleural effusions and
basilar consolidations. She continued to do well on supplemental
oxygen by nasal cannula. On the floor her oxygen requirement was
weaned. She had one episode of flash pulmonary edema, during
which she desaturated to high 80s. She was diuresed with bumex
with good effect. For the remainder of her stay, team allowed
for auto-diuresis. At time of discharge patient saturating 94%
RA, >95% 1L.
.
# Blood Pressure
.
During MICU stay pt had repeated episodes of transient
bradycardia and hypotension as well as episodes of paroxysmal
hypertension into the SBP 180-200s. Her hypertension responded
to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol. After significiant diuresis,
her SBP remained stable in the 150-160s. On the floor, BP ran
consistently high. Patient was started on metoprolol and
amlodipine. These medications were gradually uptitrated and at
time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol
50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD. She was transitioned to toprol xl
150mg daily at the time of discharge.
.
# Nutrition
.
Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to
concern for silent aspiration. In the MICU, several methods of
nutrition employed: NG tube feeds as well as PPN. On transfer to
floor patient on NG tube feeds. Repeat speech and swallow on
[**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with
continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of
tongue retraction. Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids
silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of
nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the
aspiration precautions documented below. It is important to note
aspiration is silent,
and she will need continued speech therapy follow up with likely
repeat video swallow before advancing her diet.

# Delirium
.
In the MICU observed waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status worse at
night and with spikes in fever. Symptoms improved with zyprexa
at night. The pt became more alert following extubation on [**8-3**],
however, she had some disorientation. She received several doses
of seroquel, which was discontinued when the patient became
neutropenic, as it can be a potential cause of leukopenia.  Over
the course of the next few days, her became more alert and
interactive.  By time of transfer from MICU to floor on [**8-10**],
she was fully oriented and had a good understanding of the
medical plan. On the floor, patients mentation continued to
improve. At time of discharge patient mental status was clear
and coherent.
.
# Elbow mass
.
Mass noted on right elbow.  Derm consulted; felt to be
consistent with lipoma.
.
# UTI:  She developed low grade fevers on [**8-21**] to 100.4,
prompting urinalysis, which demonstrated UTI.  She will complete
a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] to end [**2135-9-1**].

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you.
.
You were initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to symptoms of back
pain. Upon imaging it was found that you had several abscesses
throughout your spine as well as in your right knee. You
underwent several surgeries to evacuate these infection and you
were also started on antibiotics. Your antibiotic regimen was
altered several times due to significant side effects. You
experienced a rash after Nafcillin, and Vancomyocin was thought
to contribute to low cell counts. You were placed on Daptomycin
without side effect for a planned 8week course. A PICC line was
placed prior to discharge to faciliate antibiotic administration
as an outpatient. You will receive repeat imaging after
completion of your antibiotic therapy for interval evaluation of
infection.
.
Unfortunately, side effects from various medications prolonged
your hospital course. It was thought that a combination of
vancomycin and lasix contributed to decreased white blood cells
(WBC). While your WBC counts were low you were placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics to protect you from infection. We
discontinued the medications we felt responsible for declining
counts (lasix and vancomycin) and also administered a medication
called Neupogen to increase WBC production. After several days
of Neupogen treatment your white cell counts increased and
stabilized. Neupogen as well as broad spectrum antibiotics were
discontinued prior to discharge.
.
We also found your blood pressures to be elevated at times
during your hospitalization. You were started on medications,
metoprolol and amlodipine, to better control your blood
pressure.
.
Regarding nutrition, after extubation you were noted to have
difficultly swallowing. Speech and swallow was consulted and
after several attempts you completed and passed your evaluation.
After completion, you were started on a thickened nectar liquid
regimen and a soft, ground solid diet. You will need repeat
speech and swallow evaluation at rehab.
