Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo woman with recurrent Stage III papillary serous Ovarian CA
s/p TAH/BSO, two subsequent tumor debulkings, chemotherapy, RT,
now receiving home hospice, who is referred s/p
nephrostogram/tube replacement with RLQ pain, R flank pain,
fever/chills since [**1-29**]. At presentation on [**1-31**], there was no
clear evidence of infection given that her WBC was normal and
she was afebrile. Her nephrostomy pigtail was replaced and
antegrade pyelogram indicated functional nephrostomy tube and
persistent distal ureteral obstruction. On CXR, the lungs were
clear. She was admitted for pain control. However, her UA
revealed >100K WBCs and, on [**2-1**], she mounted a fever to 100.7F.
She was placed on zosyn and vancomycin was added when she was
persistently febrile.  Despite urine WBC count as above, urine
cultures revealed only yeast 10-100K.

A pain consult was requested and they recommended dilaudid PCA.
She was started on the dilaudid PCA, but had several episodes of
hypotension while on increased narcotics for her pain requiring
transfer to the ICU for monitoring.  Her PCA was discontinued
and her fentanyl patch was restarted.

Psychiatry was consulted for management of depression and
affective instability and recommendations regarding her multiple
medications including clonazepam, lorazepam, mirtazapine and
narcotics.  During her stay, she was showing signs of mild
delirium with decreased attention and concentration.  Thus
psychiatry recommended continuing her mirtazapine and
clonazepam, but suggested limiting prn ativan and narcotics as
possible, recognizing the difficulty in this given her chronic
pain.  They also suggested using seroquel for anxiety and
insomnia.

In the setting of increased pain medication, specifically
narcotics, she became hypotensive to 70s systolic.  She was
mildly lightheaded at this time.  She was transferred to the ICU
where she received IV fluids to which her BP responded with
systolics returning to the low 100s mmHg.  Her hypotension was
thought more likely [**2-8**] to her pain medication regimen and poor
PO rather than hypotension [**2-8**] to sepsis.

During her stay, multiple family meetings including her pastor
were had to evaluate code status.  She had previously been in
the care of hospice prior to this admission.  During her stay in
the setting of hypotension, code status was readdressed and she
decided that she no longer wished DNR/DNI, but wanted full code.
 While in the ICU, this was again readdressed with her family,
pastor, and patient, and code status was changed to CMO.  She
requested transfer back to her home hospice care.
