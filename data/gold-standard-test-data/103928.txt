Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Cellulitis, troponin leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bedside debridement of eschar on right foot


History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with MM including PVD, DM, HTN, CAD, CRI transferred
from NWH for cellulitis/LE pain because pt's podiatric surgeon
is at [**Hospital1 18**]. Initally presented to NWH because of increasing
right foot pain and redness. At NWH, found to have EKG changes
with STD in V2-V4, though patient was asymptomatic and said he
never had chest pain. Unclear if he received abx from there per
records available. Patient was transferred here for further
management.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 91344**] in the ICU
at NWH when he was found at home unresponsive - was hypoglycemic
and in ARF. Patient states he does not remember 'anything' about
that hospital stay, the medications he was on or any events that
occurred then. Per report, he was discharged on lovenox for DVT
but when NWH ED was [**Name (NI) 653**], records there indicated that he
was started on Lovenox ppx because he was immobile and was
supposed to continue taking it until he was able to consistently
walk >100 feet. Unclear if patient has been administering the
lovenox himself as he stated that he no longer gives himself
insulin because 'it's just too complicated'.
.
On past hospitalization at NWH, also had a troponin has high as
8.8 thought be due to demand ischemia in the setting of
hypoglycemia. During that admission, he never had chest pain and
a stable percent MB fraction at 0.7. He was started on aspirin,
beta blocker and statin. An ACEi was held due to intolerance in
the past.
.
In the ED here VS: AF, hr:67, bp:130/70, rr:16 98% on RA.
Received fentanyl for pain, cards and vascular were c/s. Blood
cx were drawn. Vascular recommended vanc/zosyn given their
concern for osteo which he received. He received 50mg iv
fentanyl for pain.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient c/o of persistent right foot
pain. Denies fever or chills, CP, SOB, N/V/D, constipation, HA
or vision changes.
.
The patient is not a competent historian. On review of systems,
he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems per HPI.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:

Xray of right foot ([**9-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Erosive bony destructions at the first distal phalanx and at
the stump of the second proximal phalanx consistent with
osteomyelitis.
2. Severe degenerative changes in the tarsometatarsal joints and
fracture at the 3rd metatarsal, suggesting early Charcot joint
disease.
3. Significant small vessel disease.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**9-20**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-12-16**],
the detected pulmonary hypertension has increased. There is no
change in the left ventricular systolic function.

ETT:
[**4-/2151**]:
This 72 yo man with IDDM, mild AS s/p multiple cadiac
interventions was referred to the lab for evaluation as a part
of the Spinal Cord Stimulation study. The patient exercised for
2.5 minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and stopped due a
marked drop in systolic
blood pressure. This represents a very limited exercise
tolerance for
his age. The patient denied any neck, chest, arm or back
discomfort
throughout the study. In the setting of baseline abnormalities,
an
additional 0.5mm of ST segment depression was noted in V4-V5 at
peak
exercise. These changes returned to baseline by minute 3
post-exercise. The rhythm was sinus with a single VPB in late
recovery period. Marked drop in blood pressure with exercise
(136/60mmHg at rest to 98/50mmHg at peak). Post-exercise
hypertension was noted (172/60mmHg at 10 minutes of recovery).
.
IMPRESSION: Marked drop in blood pressure with exercise.
Non-specific EKG changes without anginal type symptoms.
.
CARDIAC CATH:
[**2147**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
revealed
severe native three vessel disease. The LMCA had a 30%
narrowing. The
LAD had diffuse luminal irregularities and a 70% proximal
stenosis. The mid vessel was diffusely diseased but the distal
vessel filled via a patent LIMA->dLAD. The LAD supplied a large
S2 that had an 80% lesion at its ostium. The LAD supplied two
moderate sized diagonal branches which had diffuse luminal
irregularities. The LCX tapered quickly and was totally occluded
in the proximal vessel after a small OM branch. The RCA was
diffusely diseased and totally occluded proximally.
2. Selective vein graft angiography revealed a widely patent
SVG->dRCA and a widely patent SVG->D1/OM.
3. Selective arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a
widely patent LIMA->LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and
left
ventricular filling pressures with an LVEDP of 29 mmHg and a
mean PCW
pressure of 22 mmHg. In addition, there were V-waves to 50 mmHg

suggesting significant mitral regurgitation. There was evidence
of
moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of
62/21/39 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 209
dynes-sec/cm5. The cardiac output was preserved at 6.9 L/min.
Note was made of a 10 mmHg gradient across the aortic valve.
5. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient's

underlying renal insufficiency and recent non-invasive testing
documenting a preserved LV systolic function.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe native three vessel disease.
2. Patent LIMA->LAD.
3. Patent SVG->dRCA and SVG->D1/OM.
4. Moderate to severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

CT head ([**9-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Sequelae of chronic infarction involving the left
parieto-occipital
region.

Renal U/S ([**9-27**]):
IMPRESSION:

Absent diastolic flow seen in the bilateral interlobar arteries
of the
kidneys. The findings are nonspecific, but indicate renal
parenchymal
disease. There is limited evaluation of the main renal arteries,
but there is no clear evidence of renal artery stenosis. There
is no hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 74 yo M transferred from NWH with EKG changes, trop
here to 0.87 (baseline 0.2) and RLE cellulitis, right foot
osteomyelitis, worsening acute on chronic renal failure

# Right lower extremity cellulitis and right foot osteomyelitis:
The patient presented with right lower extremity cellulitis and
was found to have osteomyelitis in the right foot. Vascular
surgery evaluated the patient and thought that treatment for the
infection and ischemia would be a below the knee amputation,
though given the patient's poor cardiac status, he would not be
a good candidate for surgery. The patient was empirically
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. A wound culture grew Klebsiella
oxytoca and MRSA and continued on those antibiotics. Since
vascular surgery would be high risk, podiatry was consulted for
local debridement. They debrided the area locally, yet erythema
of the right foot existed. It remained unclear whether the
erythema was due to ischemia vs. a subcutaneous abscess, so they
recommended a MRI of the foot. The MRI was never performed
because after discussion with the family and primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was decided for the patient to become CMO. His
antibiotics were withdrawn and wound care applied to the area.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a
creatinine close to his baseline, however, after periods of
hypotension, likely due to a peri-septic state, his creatinine
starting to rise. He was given fluid boluses of 500 cc of normal
saline as needed because his urine lytes showed a FeUrea~20-25%.
Renal was consulted and thought his creatinine rise was likely
due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to a pre-renal state.
The patient was offered aluminium hydroxide for high phosphate
levels, but the patient refused it. A renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis. The patient became progressively oliguric with
UOP less than 20 cc/hour. Renal thought his kidneys would
unlikely recover (his creatinine rose to 5.3 despite
interventions). The patient and his family felt that they did
not want to pursue dialysis as an option.

#Increased troponins: The patient was noted to have high
troponins and excentuated ST wave depressions in V3-V5.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with
a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and aspirin. The patient
was started on these medications, though became persistently
hyperkalemic, and therefore, the ACEi was discontinued. Also,
his CK and LFTs were [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the statin dose of 80 mg was
lowered to 20 mg and eventually discontinued due to persistently
[**First Name3 (LF) 28645**] LFTs. An echocardiogram revealed no acute wall motion
abnormality, though it did show worsening tricuspid
regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure.
Throughout his stay, the patient did not have any chest pain.

#Increased LFTs: The patient has a known history of alcohol
abuse and increased LFTs in the past. During his peri-septic
period, the patient was noted to have increased LFTs, likely
multifactorial due to low perfusion to the liver and also
congestion secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. The patient did
not have any complaints of abdominal pain, though, he had
hepatomegaly on exam.

#Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of a GI bleed
and was guiaic positive in the ER. In addition, he had a
persistently elevated PT/PTT, likely due to either underlying
liver or hematologic disease. The patient's hematocrit remained
stable until [**9-26**] when his hematocrit dropped from 29.0 to 25.6
and was noted to have melenic stools. He continued to have
melenic stools, so he was transfused one unit of blood and
transferred to the MICU. His aspirin was discontinued. His
hematocrit remained stable in the MICU and transferred to the
floors where there were no signs of any GI bleeding.

Altered mental status: The patient had periods where he had
altered mental status, mostly at night. His AMS was likely
multifactorial due to infection, pain and uremia. He had
significant altered mental status on one day when he appeared
more somnolent with respirations=10/min after a dose of Morphine
2mg IV. Narcane was given with some effect. A head CT showed no
acute pathology. He continued to have periods of delirium mostly
at night.

#Pruritis: The patient has been complaining of pruritis,
especially on his back, since admission. A variety of remedies
were tried for wound care. According to his son, the pruritis
has been long-standing. It might be exacerbated by his renal
failure. A side effect of Morphine is a possibility, but he
still had the itching even before the morphine. He is being
treated with skin care, sarna lotion, hydrocortisone and
doxepin.

Goals of care: The patient entered the hospital as full code.
After the renal and GI bleeding complications from his illness,
the patient and his family decided to become DNR/DNI. After a
meeting with the PCP and the family, they thought the best route
would be to become comfort measures only instead of pursuing
dialysis and being chronically cared for in a nursing home. At
first, it was thought that his beta blocker, aspirin, and
antibiotics would be continued, however, after further
conversation, these medications were discontinued and only
palliative measures for insomnia, anxiety, pain and constipation
were ordered.
