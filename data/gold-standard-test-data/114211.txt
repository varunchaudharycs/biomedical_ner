Pertinent Results:

CT head [**2200-11-7**]
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. Expected
post-surgical
changes.
.
CXR [**2200-11-2**]
FINDINGS: Right internal jugular vascular catheter has been
repositioned, now terminating in the mid superior vena cava,
with no visible pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube have been removed. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
appearance. Persistent right lower lobe scarring versus
atelectasis adjacent to surgical chain sutures as well as a
small right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening. No new
or worsening lung or pleural abnormalities.
.
ECG [**2200-11-2**]
Sinus tachycardia, rate 107 with frequent ventricular premature
beats. There is moderate baseline artifact. Left atrial
abnormality. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2200-10-28**],
except for the change in rate and the presence of frequent
ventricular premature beats, no diagnostic interval change.
.
Brain Tissue Biopsy
DIAGNOSIS:
I. Brain, right craniotomy:
Necrosis and changes consistent with radiation changes. See
note.
II. Brain, right craniotomy:
Necrosis and changes consistent with radiation changes. See
note.
.
MRI BRAIN [**2200-10-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal enhancing mass from tumor/radiation necrosis at
the
resection site with associated significant perilesional edema/
radiation
induced changes. There is extensive perilesional FLAIR and T2
hyperintensity
surrounding this mass. There is mild decrease in enhancement as
compared to the previous MRIS with no change in the perilesional
hyperintensity. This mass is likely to represent radiation
induced necrosis rather than residual/ recurrent neoplasm. For
surgical planning.
2. No evidence of new enhancing lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 102120**] presented from an outside hospital with severe
headaches and nausea. Thallium scan that was inconclusive. The
neurosurgical team saw the patient and agreed to do a craniotomy
and biopsy. Following the surgery, was cared for by the
neurosurgical team for several days. The patient had some relief
to nausea and headache, but symptoms were not completely
resolved. The pathology shows necrosis and arrangements were
made for an outpatient family meeting with neuroncology next
week.  In the meantime, he will go to a living facility. During
his stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 76901**] received PT for general weakness.
