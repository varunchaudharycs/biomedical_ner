Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress, Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is a 69 y/o Russian-speaking male with PMH
significant for metastatic renal CA to brain and lungs, s/p LLL
lobectomy, s/p TURP [**1-18**] prostate CA, colon CA s/p colectomy, who
presents to the ED from NH with respiratory distress. History is
limited by patient's non-verbal state and wife's limited
English. Per wife, patient has been in the [**Name (NI) **] since [**5-22**] [**1-18**] CVA
involving the right extremities. His mental status has been poor
at baseline and has increasingly worsened to a non-verbal state
approx one month ago. Beginning two nights ago, the patient was
noted to have some respiratory distress, requiring oxygen and
was started on Augmentin for a presumed PNA. However, his
respiratory status did not improve and was noted to have a
low-grade temp of 100.9, RR 30, HR 140, BP 155/88, SaO2 94% on
supplemental O2 (unknown amount), prompting the NH to send the
patient to the ED early this morning.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have a Tc of 103.8 (rectally), HR
134, BP 124/74, RR 42, SaO2 88%/NRB. His labs were notable for a
WBC of 27.9 (97% N, no bands) and lactate of 2. He received
combivent nebs, 1 gm tylenol pr, 500 cc of NS bolus, 1 gm
ceftaz, 500 mg IV flagyl, and 1 gm of vanc. His sats improved
while in the ED and he was weaned down to 4 L NC. ABG on 4L was
7.49/34/82/31.

Patient was admitted to the MICU and admitted on broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Discussion was held with family and patient was
made DNR/DNI/no pressors.

.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
The patient is status post right nephrectomy. The left kidney
measures 13.4 cm. The calyces are mildly prominent throughout
the left kidney, however, there is no frank evidence of
hydronephrosis. No stones or masses are identified. The bladder
is catheterized and empty.
.
Video Swallow:
FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation
was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow pathology.
Patient was administered various consistencies of barium
including thin, nectar, thick, and ground cookie. Posterior oral
transit was moderately delayed. In addition, swallowing
initiation was severely impaired with significantly delayed
swallowing initiation to large boluses. When swallow was
initiated, there was some adequate epiglottic deflection, and
laryngeal valve closure. However, there was silent aspiration to
thin liquids. The patient had difficulties following commands
during the examination, and would not take cookie or straw.
IMPRESSION: Severe swallow initiation delay with aspiration to
thins. For further details, please consult the speech and
swallow pathology note.
.
CT Head:
CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with
somnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a large hyperdense lesion involving the left frontal
lobe near the convexity measuring 4.2 x 4 cm and surrounded by
vasogenic edema, with mass effect seen over the left lateral
ventricle. There is minimal midline shift to the right. The
edema extends inferiorly into the left frontoparietal white
matter and the left temporal lobe. The ventricular system is not
dilated. There is no intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage.
The fourth ventricle remains in the midline. There is
heterogeneous hyperdense lesion abutting the right frontal
aspect of the calvarium along the midline. This could represent
volume averaging. No lytic lesions are identified. Chronic
mucosal thickening is seen within the paranasal sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION: 4-cm hyperdense necrotic mass lesion involving the
left frontal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema and
associated with sulcal effacement and surrounding mass effect as
noted above. This is most likely metastatic in nature given the
history of renal cell cancer. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage was
seen.
.
CT Chest:
Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous
or oral contrast administration. Images are presented for
display in the axial plane at both 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.
.
There is near complete opacification of the remaining portion of
the left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lung
at the apical portion. Assessment of the central airways
demonstrates complete obstruction of the left main bronchus just
beyond its origin. The contents within the obstructed bronchus
range from fluid to soft tissue attenuation. Superiorly, there
are some areas of consolidation and ground-glass superimposed
upon underlying areas of emphysema, but beginning in the mid
portion of the left lung, opacified lung is relatively
homogeneous without air bronchograms. An area of curvilinear
calcification is present in the lower left hemithorax
posteriorly and there are surgical clips present in the
paraaortic and perihilar regions.
.
The left lobe of the thyroid gland is markedly enlarged and
heterogeneous. The superior portion of the enlarged lobe is not
completely imaged on this scan, and it is difficult to exclude
adjacent areas of lymphadenopathy in the left neck as well. The
enlarged thyroid gland results in rightward displacement and
coronal narrowing of the trachea which is narrowed to
approximately 8 mm at the thoracic inlet level. There is bulky
mediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with the
right paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and a
left prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm. A bulky left
lower paratracheal lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.0 cm. The left
hilum is difficult to assess without intravenous contrast but
there is probable left hilar lymphadenopathy as well.
.
There is left-sided pleural thickening contiguous with the area
of homogeneous opacification in the left lower lung region. This
is contiguous with an area of chest wall destruction involving a
lower left lateral rib which is partially destroyed by the mass.
Enlarged nodes are also present in the lower left paraaortic
region and in the left extrapleural space.
.
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there are bulky
lymph node masses which are incompletely imaged on this study.
These are in the region of the celiac axis anterior to the
aorta, measuring up to approximately 5.5 and 6.4 cm in greatest
dimension. A left anterior peridiaphragmatic enlarged node is
present as well as left retroperitoneal node enlargement. The
adrenal glands are incompletely imaged on this study. Calcified
gallstone is observed within the gallbladder. No definite
lesions are seen within the liver but lack of intravenous
contrast limits assessment.
.
As noted, the trachea is compressed and displaced by the thyroid
mass. Fluid level within the intrathoracic trachea is probably
due to retained secretions. Within the right lung, there are
several small pulmonary nodules present, some of which are well
circumscribed, and others of which are more poorly defined. The
largest individual nodule is a poorly defined lateral segment
right middle lobe nodule measuring 10 mm on image 31 of series
3. Respiratory motion limits assessment of the right lower lobe
and right middle lobe.
.
Skeletal structures reveal partial destruction of the left
seventh lateral rib as described above. Post-thoracotomy changes
are present just above this level. Healed lower right anterior
rib fractures are noted without definite associated lytic
lesions.
.
Finally, incidental note is made of a calcified granuloma in the
periphery of the right middle lobe.

IMPRESSION:
1. Complete obstruction left main bronchus. Although possibly
due to retained secretions, obstructing endobronchial lesion is
likely in this patient with history of renal cell carcinoma.
Correlative bronchoscopy would be helpful.
2. Postobstructive collapse/consolidation in left upper lobe
(status post left lower lobectomy). Associated soft tissue mass
with dystrophic calcifications, contiguous or adjacent to chest
wall mass with destruction of the left lateral seventh rib.
3. Bulky mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy
consistent with metastatic disease. Dedicated contrast-enhanced
CT torso could be considered to more completely characterize the
extent of metastatic disease if warranted clinically.
4. Marked enlargement of left lobe of thyroid gland with
displacement and compression of trachea. It is difficult to
exclude adjacent lymphadenopathy in the left neck.
5. Left-sided pleural thickening and small amount of pleural
fluid.
6. Scattered nodules in the right lung, some of which are well
defined and likely reflect metastatic foci and others of which
are poorly defined and likely are related to the infection.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course, by Problem:

#Respiratory Distress:  initially thought to be d/t aspiration
PNA.  Was intially treated with broad spectum abx (Vanc, CTX,
Flagyl).  Blood and Urine Cx negative but sputum did grow MRSA.
To sort out whether the patient simply had aspiration
pnuemonitis vs PNA, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.  This
showed almost complete collapse of the remaining portion of his
left lung from a L mainstem bronchus lesion, concerning for
metastatic disease.  It also showed narrowing of the trachea to
approx 8 mm from an enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, which is
stable in size according to his outside oncologists.  Because of
renal failure (see below), the patient was switched to Linezolid
to cover MRSA; CTX/Flagyl were continued to cover for ?
post-obstructive process. He will complete a today of a 10 day
course of antitiotics to end on [**9-15**].
.
#Acute Renal Failure:  during his hosptial course, his Cr rose
from a baseline of 0.3-0.4 to a peak of 2.2.  Renal U/S
negative.  Urine indicies not c/w pre-renal state, Urine Eos
neagtive.  Renal team consulted; felt to be secondary to ATN,
most likely from vancomycin.  Cr now starting to improve (2.0 on
day of discharge).
.
#Cerebral Mets:  on CT scan, there was noted to me marked
vasogenic edmema.  The patients DMS was increased to 4 mg IV q 8
hours and should be continued indefinatley as the patient
appears to be more awake when on the higher dose.  They can be
decreased should the patient develop agitation.
.
#ONC issues/goals of care:  after the Left mainstem lesion was
discovered, both interventional pulmonary team and radiation
team were consulted.  Both felt that bronchoscopy and radition
therapy would add little to his quality/quantity of life, given
his extremely poor performance status and prognosis.  His wife
was in agreement that he should not receive any invasive
procedures in the future.  She understood that should the
patient develop subsequent respiratory distress, she should not
be brought back to the hospital but should be given morphine and
ativan for comfort.
.
#Anemia:  high ferrtin c/w Anemia of Chronic Disease.  Stable.
.
#FEN:  the patient had speech/swallow evaluation which showed
moderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced
bolus control and formation as well as a significant pharyngeal
swallow initiation delay with mild silent
aspiration of thin liquids.   The speech/swallow team
recommended Nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, PO meds
crushed in purees, along with 1:1 assistance for meals, strict
aspiration precautions.
