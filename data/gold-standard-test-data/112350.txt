Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
49 year-old man with a history of bipolar/schizoaffective
disorder, hypothyroidism, recent admission to OSH with HA who
was transferred with recurrent HA, nausea and new left parietal
hemorrhage.

At admission, patient was found to be a poor historian and much
of the history was apparently taken from medical records per OSH
and the pt's sister.

Per sister, pt first presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-29**] with ~8-9 days of
nearly daily headache, nausea and vomiting. She was unable to
provide details of headache. PCP arranged for head CT which was
normal, and pt sent home. Sister accompanied him home, and
realized that pt having difficulty with tasks such as dialing
phone or using spoon. Normally pt lives alone, and sister felt
he was unsafe so brought him to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital,
where he was admitted from [**Date range (1) 65003**]. While there, he had MRI
that per OSH discharge summary showed small bilateral strokes in
postrior parietal parasaggital region near the parieto-occipital
fissure, thought to be watershed however this was not observed.
Also in differential was possible viral meningoencephalitis.
Stroke workup with negative carotid US, echo, normal lipids and
A1C, no arrythmias. He was started on ASA. On discharge he had
full strength, was still having difficulty making phone calls.
Headache had improved, though not fully resolved. Sister reports
that he was getting percocet in hospital, though he was not
discharged with any.

Since discharge, sister reports that pt complaining of slowly
worsening headache. Also has been complaining of trouble seeing,
"I can't see the kitchen sink." He saw his PCP yesterday who
thought headaches might be migraines, and gave him Zomig. Today
the headache worsened and pt returned to OSH ED. Head CT showed
left parieto-occipital bleed and pt transferred for further
management.

Per sister and brother-in-law, pt "does OK on all your tests,
but he still has trouble functioning, such as trouble getting
dressed." At baseline (prior to recent headaches) pt did have
some cognitive difficulties, and some trouble articulating. He
is worse now, but it is not entirely clear the time course of
this. The trouble making phone calls is definitely new. Also of
note, he has had some recent med changes after psych
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **] ~3 months ago. Also, while at OSH pt
refused risperdal and was started on seroquel instead.

Currently, pt reports vertex headache, am unable to get any more
details. Also reports +nausea, trouble talking and trouble
seeing. No chest pain, abdominal pain. Notes some left leg
weakness as well.


Social History:
Lives alone, is own guardian. Sister had been his guardian in
the past but apparently a court has determined that she is no
longer allowed to hold this position.

Pertinent Results:
MRI/MRA [**12-24**]: 1. MR features of a 43 x 34 mm intracerebral
hematoma at the left parietal/occipital region, with surrounding
vasogenic edema, and extension of hemorrhage into the adjacent
subarachnoid spaces and ventricular system. 2. No obstructive
hydrocephalus is seen at present. 3. No pathological enhancement
to identify an underlying lesion relating to
the left parietal-occipital hematoma. 4. Normal brain MR
angiography.
.
TTE: No valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi seen.
EF>55%. No PFO/ASD.
.
CT head [**1-8**]: There has been evolution of the previously noted
blood products in the left parieto-occipital region, overall
unchanged in extent in the interval. However, new in the
interval is hypodensity in the left internal capsule and
thalamus, which is exerting slight mass effect on the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. This is concerning for acute
or subacute infarction. No new intracranial hemorrhage or other
new suspicious areas of hypodensity are noted. There is no
hydrocephalus. The basilar cisterns are visible. The mastoid air
cells are opacified bilaterally. The remainder of the paranasal
sinuses and the orbits are unremarkable.
.
EEG [**1-8**]: IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the
presence of a focal
area of slowing in the left anterior quadrant suggestive of a
subcortical abnormality in this region. Background frequencies
were
also somewhat slower than normal, suggesting the presence of a
mild
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
.
CTA neck [**1-10**]: 1. Left internal jugular vein thrombosis as
described. Question of left sigmoid sinus partial thrombosis,
versus mixing artifact.
2. Mastoid and partial ethmoid and sphenoid sinus opacification.
.
CT head [**1-12**]: 1. New hemorrhagic transformation of left caudate
nucleus infarction. Blood products within the fourth ventricle.
Close clinical followup and followup CT scan recommended.
2. Probable superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and possible
thrombosis of the left sigmoid sinus, with continued thrombosis
of the left internal jugular vein.
.
CT head [**1-29**] (compared to [**1-19**]):  There has been no significant
change from [**2156-1-20**] with a stable appearing left
frontal hemorrhage with surrounding edema. There is also a
resolving region of hypodensity from hemorrhage in the left
temporal lobe. There is stable appearance of the effaced frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. No new foci of hemorrhage
are indicated. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is some left sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION: Multiple stable hemorrhages as described above with
no new significant change from [**2156-1-20**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65004**] is a 49 yo RHM with h/o bipolar/schizoaffective
disorder, hypothyroidism, who was transferred with complaints of
headache for about a month and nausea. Upon admission he was
found to have a large left parietal hemorrhage. The exam upon
admission was notable for inattention, anomia, right field cut,
mild-moderate R hemiparesis, and perseveration.
.
Neuro:
The patient was transferred to the Neuro/ICU  for telemetry and
aggressive blood pressure control. Neurosurgery evaluated him
and no surgical intervention was necessary. His MRI/MRA scans
revealed a large (~40cc) hemorrhage near the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction
in the left parietal lobe. There was no clear underlying mass
and there were no underlying vascular abnormalities per MRA (no
aneurysms/AVM). An ECHO, to look for a cardio-embolic etiology,
was negative (no valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi;
no PFO/ASD, but not with certainty as the image quality was
poor).
Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] then developed a L thalamic infarct [**1-8**], and was
less alert, with increased R hemiparesis. An EEG ([**1-8**]) showed
focal slowing in the L anterior quadrant. A hemorrhagic
conversion of the infract was then noted on [**1-12**] with some
intraventricular blood (found incidentally when getting CTV).
The CTV ([**1-12**]) showed a L superior sagittal sinus thrombosis
and ?L sigmoid sinus thrombosis  with extension into the
internal jugular vein. A repeat head CT [**1-14**], showed no
evidence of hydrocephalus, and no further blood in 4th
ventricle.
Mr. [**Known lastname 65004**] was started on anticoagulation with Lovenox on [**1-13**].

He was also given a short course of Diamox for L hemisphere
edema. Neurosurg was re-consulted to monitor the hemorrhage into
the 4th ventricle given the risk of hydrocephalus. No
intervention was necessary. Follow up CT-head series showed a
stable picture.
.
Psychiatry:
The patient was maintained on seroquel. Depakote was
discontinued, and lithium was started [**1-6**]. Lithium levels
should be monitored closely (every 2 weeks) and the dosing
should be adjusted accordingly. The patient has been closely
followed by the psychiatry service. Please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65005**],
[**Numeric Identifier 65006**] if any questions arise. Close follow up will be
arranged. Haldol was given on a PRN basis.
.
Cardiovascular:
An Echo showed an EF>55%. The patient was ruled out for an MI
[**1-8**]. Goal SBP<160. Lipids profile was within normal limits.
EKG should be checked if the patient receives haldol on a
regular basis (risk for prolonged QT).
.
FEN/GI:
-cardiac prudent diet
.
Hematology:
The patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic w/nadir in 80s,
likely secondary to Depakote. Plt normalized after Depakote was
discontinued.
As part of a workup related to the sinus thrombosis the
following tests were done:
-No LE DVT on [**1-11**] U/S.
-Hypercoagulable workup: Fibrinogen 482, D-dimer 2938.
Homocysteine wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] neg, Lupus anticoagulant neg, ATIII wnl,
FVL neg. Prot C slightly low 63, Prot S elevated (?acute phase
reactant). Factor VIII and anticardiolipin normal. Prothrombin
gene mutation pending. Please resend hypercoag workup again in
the future if Pt ever comes off anticoagulation.
The patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as he is
not a coumadin candidate. Lovenox level 2.0 on [**1-26**], after which
the dose was decreased; level on [**2-1**]: 1.06; level on [**2-3**]: 0.9
(i.e. within goal range).
.
Other:
The patient has had multiple falls [**12-31**], [**1-5**], [**1-6**] x2, all
secondary to orthostasis, a R field cut, and impulsivity. Please
check orthostatics in case the patient is unsteady.
.
Endocrine:
-TSH 3.4; Levoxyl was continued. Please continue to monitor.
-HbA1C 5.2, no intervention needed.
.
ID:
On Cipro [**Date range (1) 14813**] for E. coli UTI. UA on [**2-2**] was negative.
.
ENT:
Sinus opacification upon admission. This has resolved. If
patient becomes symptomatic he will need ENT follow up.
.
Legal: Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] has a legal guardian since [**1-30**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] is
incompetent to sign consent for procedures as he cannot clearly
understand its risks and benefits. His sister who had been his
previous guardian was legally not permitted to hold this
position any longer.
