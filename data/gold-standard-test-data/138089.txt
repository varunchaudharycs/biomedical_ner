Admission Date:  [**2106-7-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-7-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-12-21**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old gentleman
with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
estimated ejection fraction of approximately 20%.  He had
been accepted by the [**Hospital 4415**] heart
transplant service and was at home listed as a status 2
awaiting cardiac transplantation.

On [**2106-7-4**] the patient had new onset chest pain and was
admitted to the hospital where he ruled in for myocardial
infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Type 1 diabetes.  2. Known coronary
artery disease status post multiple cardiac catheterizations.
He is status post automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement.  He has ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  3. Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Coreg 25 mg p.o. q.d.  2.
Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.  3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  4. Aspirin
325 mg p.o. q.d.  5. Aldactone 12 mg p.o. q.d.  6. Synthroid
0.125 p.o. q.d.  7. Lantus insulin 25 q.d.  8. Humalog
sliding scale subcutaneous insulin coverage.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor cause a cough.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have
significant multivessel coronary artery disease including a
30% left main and 99% left anterior descending coronary
artery, totally occluded left circumflex and totally occluded
right coronary.  His left ventricular ejection fraction was
estimated at 13% at cardiac catheterization.  The patient was
then referred to the cardiothoracic surgery service for
assessment for coronary artery bypass grafting.

The patient subsequently preoperatively was managed on the
cardiology service approximately [**2106-7-8**], was noted to have
a dropping hematocrit and was sent for an urgent CT scan of
his abdomen and pelvis to rule out a source of hematocrit
drop.  He was found to have no intra-abdominal nor
retroperitoneal hematoma at that time however it was noted
that he had a pericardial effusion.  The patient also on
[**2106-7-8**] underwent a myocardial viability study which showed
diffuse uptake consistent with diffuse viability of left
ventricular wall.  The patient remained on the cardiology
service and was taken to the operating room on [**2106-7-12**] where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  He had a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein to the
RPL, saphenous vein to the D1, to the OM.  The patient had a
preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump placed at the
beginning of the case prophylactically due to his poor
ejection fraction.  The patient did wean from cardiopulmonary
bypass and his chest was being closed when he was noted to
have significant problems with hypotension.  At that time it
was felt appropriate to place him on a left ventricular
assist device.  He was also placed on vasopressin,
epinephrine, Levophed, and milrinone drips.  With the support
of the left ventricular assist device and the pressors and
inotropic agents the patient was successfully transported
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit
in the evening of [**2106-7-12**] where he proceeded to wake up from
general anesthesia.  He required some fluid resuscitation
with blood products over the course of the first few
postoperative hours and remained relatively stable on the
support.

On physical examination at this time, neurologically the
patient is sedated on propofol but is easily awoken, follows
commands, nods his head appropriately and moves all
extremities.  From a cardiac standpoint the patient has a
blood pressure from 90 to 110s systolic with a mean arterial
pressure of 65 to 70, presently on vasopressin, epinephrine,
Levophed and milrinone drips.  He is on an left ventricular
assist device, Abiomed BVAD 5000 I, with liter flows between
5 and 5.6 liters per minute.  His thermodilution cardiac
output has also been in the 5 to 6 liter per minute range
with an SvO2 of approximately 70%.  The patient's lungs are
rhonchorous.  The patient has adequate oxygenation at this
time.  His abdomen is soft, nontender.  His extremities are
warm with minimal edema and he has positive Doppler signals
in both of his feet.  Immediately postoperatively the
patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was removed at the
bedside.  Manual pressure was held for 35 minutes.  The groin
looks good without signs of bleeding or hematoma and the
pulse remains audible by Doppler in his balloon foot, which
is the right.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. IV vasopressin drip at 0.8 units per
minute.  2. Epinephrine 0.025 mcg per kg per minute.  3.
Levophed 0.02 mcg per kg per minute.  4. Milrinone 0.5 mcg
per kg per minute.  5. Propofol 30.  6. Vancomycin 1 gram q.
12 hours.  7. Carafate 1 gram q. 6 hours.  8. Aspirin 325 mg
q.d.  9. Ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.  10. Insulin drip at 29
units per hour, maintaining a blood sugar in the 120-140
range at this time.

MOST RECENT LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.4,
hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 167.  Sodium 138, potassium
3.7, chloride 103, CO2 17, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9, glucose
131.  His most recent prothrombin time is 15.1 with an INR of
1.5, PTT is 42.6.  Blood gas from this morning is pH 7.42,
PaCO2 32, PaO2 116, bicarbonate 21, base deficit -2.
Initially postoperatively the patient had a significant
metabolic acidosis which resolved with a total of [**3-1**] amps of
bicarbonate over the course of the night, blood products and
fluid resuscitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Ischemic cardiomyopathy with left
ventricular assist device placement status post coronary
artery bypass grafting x 4.

CONDITION:  His condition remains critical.

DISPOSITION:  He is being transported to the [**Hospital 8503**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36737**] for assessment
for heart transplant as well as possible HeartMate left
ventricular assist device placement in the next few days.
