was given insulin, D50, calcium gluconate.  ECG was V paced
without any T wave changes. 10 mg IV Vitamin K given, 1 unit FFP
and PRBCs ordered (and given in ED). CTA done in the ED.  GI and
renal aware.  On transfer, vitals were 70s paced 106/59 no
fluids RR 15 98% RA.  A left groin cordis was placed.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient had large melanotic bowel
movement, otherwise HD stable.

Of note, patient states that she had an EGD at [**Hospital1 112**] showing
gastritis and healed ulcers, as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] which showed
polyps that were removed.

IMAGING:
[**2148-7-2**] CT abdomen/pelvis w/o con:
1. Left femoral venous catheter has an unusually short
intra-vascular course.
2. 4.6-cm rounded structure in the gallbladder fossa contains a
dependent calcification and demonstrates no inflammatory change.
This potentially represents a post-operative collection without
surrounding inflammation or a retained portion of the
gallbladder. Correlation with detailed surgical history is
suggested.
3. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis
4. Focus of air within bladder. Please correlate with history
for recent instrumentation.
5. Severe vascular calcifications.
.
[**2148-7-2**] GI Bleeding Study: Blood flow images show normal tracer
flow through the large vessels of the abdominal and pelvic
vasculature. Dynamic images of the abdomen show tracer
extravasation in the right upper quadrant likely in the hepatic
flexure of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] at the onset of the study. Over 72 minutes,
there is relatively little transit of isotope reaching only the
region of the mid-transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**]; slow transit is typical of
bleeding in the large bowel.
IMPRESSION: GI bleed likely in the region of the hepatic flexure
of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
.
[**2148-7-2**] CXR: Exam is limited as the bilateral bases are
excluded from the field of view. Where seen the lungs appear
clear. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged likely
accentuated by positioning however is unchanged. Dense
atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch. Osseous and
soft tissue structures are unchanged.
.
[**2148-7-2**] Mesenteric angiogram by IR:
1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease, with calcification of
multiple vessels seen on fluoroscopic images without contrast.
2. Right common femoral artery access was obtained.
Atherosclerotic disease but patent right common femoral artery
with contrast flowing through and around the sheath.
3. SMA angiography demonstrated no evidence of active
extravasation, specifically within the right [**Month/Day/Year 499**] or hepatic
flexure. Additional selective angiography of the middle colic
and right colic arteries demonstrated no active extravasation
within the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] or visualized portions of small bowel branches.

4. Celiac artery angiography demonstrated no active
extravasation within the right upper quadrant. Specifically, no
active extravasation is seen within the GDA.
5. Angiography of the hepatic artery demonstrated a 5-6 mm
pseudoaneurysm arising off the right hepatic artery. This is
likely an incidental finding. No active extravasation was seen
from this into any biliary ducts or outside of the vessel lumen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of active extravasation on this
mesenteric angiogram.
.
[**2148-7-3**] CTA abdomen/pelvis:
1. Suboptimal bolus limits evaluation for active GI bleeding,
although existing high-density intraluminal contents suggests
extravasation from prior angiogram.
2. Mild bladder wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding is
suggestive of cystitis, correlate with urinalysis. Further, air
seen within the bladder wall may relate to prior Foley placement
but emphysematous cystitis is not excluded.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis, without aneurysm.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis and
cholelithiasis in a gallbladder remnant without cholecystitis.
5. Left adnexal cystic lesion is not fully characterized on this
study.  If warranted, a non-urgent pelvic ultrasound may be
performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old female with SLE, DMI, HTN, ESRD on HD, paroxysmal
afib s/p PV isolation x2, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacer, PVD
with SFA stent placement, and NSTEMI s/p DES to LAD and BMS to
OM1 on [**2148-6-21**] on aspirin, plavix, and coumadin who presented
with melena and BRBPR.
.
# GIB: Patient presented with melena and BRBPR, suspicious for
either an upper or lower GI source. The EGD showed mild
gastritis but no active bleeding. The flex sig was also negative
for active bleeding. The tagged RBC scan was positive in the
hepatic flexure, however when she was taken to IR for a
mesenteric angiogram, there was no active bleeding. She
continued to have melena so underwent an abdominal CTA (after
prep for her iodine allergy), which was also negative for active
bleeding. She was scheduled for a colonoscopy which was then
cancelled due to her Afib with RVR (see below). Overall she
received 8 units of PRBCs, 3 units of FFP, and 1 unit of
platelets while in the ICU.  It was determined by the team that
the colonoscopy can be deferred to the outpatient setting given
her relative stability.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: S/p two ablations in the past, now with
pacemaker. We continued her amiodarone but initially held her
home metoprolol and diltizem in the setting of the GIB. She went
into AFib with RVR on MICU day #3 so she was given IV diltiazem
and metoprolol and her home metoprolol and diltiazem were
restarted. However, she continued to have RVR and required a
diltiazem gtt.  She was eventually transitioned to her home
doses.
.
# ESRD: On Tues/Thurs/Sat dialysis schedule, which was continued
in the MICU.
.
# CAD: Patient with NSTEMI one week ago s/p DES to LAD and BMS
to OM1. We continued aspirin/plavix despite the GIB given risk
for in-stent thrombosis one week out. This was discussed with
her [**Date Range **] outpatient cardiologist.
.
# PVD s/p SFA stenting recently: Recent peripheral angiogram by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] with angioplasty/stenting of the left SFA and
angioplasty of the left tibial artery; had been on plavix prior
to NSTEMI. She has 2 gangrenous toes, which appear similar to
prior. Continued aspirin/Plavix.
.
# Chronic pain: Continued home gabapentin and dilaudid.
.
# Depression: Continued sertraline.

# Goals of Care: Patient expressing interest in rethinking her
goals of care.  She is considering a do not hospitalize, but
would like to talk things over with her family before making
these decisions.  She will speak to her primary care doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1057**], about these issues. She had declined rehab while in the
MICU and was very insistent on going home. Because she had good
family support and very good insight into her condition, she was
discharged home with close follow up by the MICU team. She felt
weak at home and was not able to navigate her home as well as
she would have liked. The [**Last Name (STitle) 2287**] case managers arranged for her
to go to [**Hospital 1785**] Rehab from home the day after admission. The
MICU team was in communication with the case manager and primary
care doctor during the post-discharge period in order to
faciliatate a proper disposition. There is a separate note in
OMR detailing this.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI Bleed


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 21056**]:

It was a pleasure to take care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were seen
in the hospital because of a gastrointestinal bleed, likely
secondary to a high INR.  Your coumadin was held and you were
transfused with multiple units of blood.  Your blood counts then
remained stable.  You will likely need to follow up with an
outpatient gastroenterologist for a colonosocpy at some point in
the next several months.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STOP Coumadin - You should have a conversation with your primary
care doctor about when you should restart this medication given
your bleed
DECREASE aspirin to 81 mg daily
START pantoprazole 40 mg PO twice a day
STOP Omeprazole


Followup Instructions:
You need to make an appointment to see your primary care doctor
within the next week.
