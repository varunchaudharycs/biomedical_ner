History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic renal
insufficiency secondary to cyclosporine, extensive GI bleeding
over the past several years, presenting with multiple episodes
of BRBPR starting on the morning of admission. Pt was initially
admitted to the OMED service with a hct drop of 4 points and was
transfused 2U PRBC and 3U pf HLA matched platelets for a
platelet count of 14. She was also given DDAVP for presumed
dysfunctional platelets. She was hemodynamically stable. Last
night she was also found to be febrile and was started on
Cefepime and Flagyl and then changed over to Zosyn as she
complained of severe nausea on Flagyl.
This am the patient developed worsening BRBPR and again had one
bloody stool with associated abdominal pain as well as
hypotension with a systolic BP of 90 and tachycardia. She was
transfused another 3U PRBC and her BP and HR normalized again.
The patient then went to nuclear medicine and subsequently was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

ROS: negative for lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations,
SOB, dysuria or altered mental status. She reports fatigue, mild
cramping abdominal pain, and increased number of echymoses
across her abdomen, arms, and legs.

Imaging:
CXR: Single AP view of the chest reveals the tip of a port line
in the SVC in satisfactory position.  The mediastinum is
midline.  There is peribronchial thickening and increased
markings in both lung bases without gross consolidation however
early pneumonitis in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
.
Nuclear bleeding scan: negative per oral report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: progression of opacities, likely PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome, with fever and
neutropenia, with decreased o2 sats and SOB.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
progression of opacities, likely PCP pneumonia
HISTORY: Fever. Shortness of breath.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates similar
cardiomediastinal contour to that seen on [**2138-10-15**]. Right-sided
Port-A-Cath remains unchanged. Increased opacity involving the
bilateral lungs remains similar in appearance. There is very
mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles. Trachea is
midline.

IMPRESSION:

No interval change.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-9-28**] 3:47 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for infiltrates

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with MDS fevers, acute hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for infiltrates
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT of the chest without contrast.

INDICATION: 70-year-old female with history of myelodysplastic
syndrome presenting with fevers, acute hypoxia. Assess for
infiltrates.

COMPARISONS: [**2138-9-24**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the lungs are acquired. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are several,
subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes. No pathologically
enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are present. A small
pericardial effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared to
the examination four days prior. A moderate- to large-sized
hiatal hernia is also again noted.

Lung windows demonstrate dramatic interval change with diffuse,
ground-glass opacities present throughout both lungs, mostly new
compared to the previous examination. A few pulmonary nodules
within the right lung are again noted and unchanged compared to
the previous examination. Incidental note is also made of
bibasilar atelectasis.

No lytic or blastic lesions within the osseous structures are
noted. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal air-space process throughout both lungs
dramatically new compared to examination from four days prior.
Given the non-pathologic but prominent mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, infectious etiologies including atypical
infections if the patient is immunocompromised should be
considered. ARDS given the timing of these findings is also a
diagnostic consideration. Clinical correlation is advised. No
pleural effusion.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:55 pm by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 7747**] over the telephone on [**2138-9-28**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 y.o. woman with myelodysplastic syndrome and resultant
pancytopenia and recurrent GIB associated with ulcerations in
her small intestine.
.
# GI Bleeding: Likely due from previously discovered small
intestinal ulcerations, with increased propensity for bleeding
given thrombocytopenia. No evidence of UGIB. Baseline hct 32,
was 22 on admission.  On the second day of hospitalization the
patient had further bleeding per rectum, became hypotensive, and
had sinus tachycardia to 140.  She was soon transferred to the
MICU.  While in the ICU, Angiography did not show active bleed,
although unable to catheterize the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].  Tagged RBC study also
did not show site of bleed.  At present, there are no surgical
or endoscopic options, so will continue with supportive care.
NG lavage was negative.  The patient received numerous PRBC
transfusions.  Platelets remain above 50 after many platelent
transufsions.  After stabilization, the patient was transferred
to the floor where she remained hemodynamically stable for the
remainder of her hospitalization.  She did have occasional
BRBPR, and always remained guaiac positive.  She continued to
receive prbc's nearly every other day to maintain a stable
hematocrit, and she received HLA matched platelets on nearly a
daily basis to maintain her platelet count over 50.
.
# Neutropenic fever: The patient finished her 5th day of
decitabine for MDS treatment on [**9-12**].  Previous to decitabine
therapy the patient had adequate cell counts, and after
decitabine the patient became progressively  neutropenic.  On
return to the floor form the MICU the patient proceeded to spike
daily fevers as high as 103.0, with associated rigors.  The
source of fever was not identified.  Daily blood cultures were
negative. stool was C.Diff negative.  The patient placed  on
several antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl, and
fluconazole, and continued to spike. CT chest/Abdomen/Pelvis on
[**9-24**] did not reveal a source of fevers. CT Pelvis
revealed fat stranding and questionable external iliac [**Last Name (un) **]
thrombus, followup MRI showed fat stranding but no thrombus.
Antibiotics eventually switched to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl
(cefepime was discontinued secondary to drug rash), to
Vanc/Aztreonam/Caspofungin. The patient desaturated on [**9-28**] to
78%, and CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.  Clinical
suspicion for PCP was high, and after consulting ID, the patient
was maintained on Vanc/Caspo/Meropenem, and the patient was
begun on Bactrim and steroids empirically, unable to perform
bronchoscopy with the high likelihood of being unable to
extubate her.  Soon after Bactrim administration her fevers
stopped. She was continued with a full 14 day course of IV
Bactrim. After completing this course she was transitioned to
Bactrim DS 3 times weekly.

.
#O2 desaturation-Patient began to desat on [**9-26**]. Thought
initially to be due to fluid overload in setting of increased
platelet and prbc transfusions, and CT on [**9-24**] showing bibasilar
atelectasis.  Oxygen improved with lasix on [**9-26**] and [**9-27**], and
patient was saturating at 94% on room air on [**9-27**].  Patient
desaturated to 78% on [**9-28**].  CT chest showed extensive
infiltrates.  ID reccomended broad antibiotic coverage, and
biggest concern was for PCP in the setting of an
immunocompromised patient.  She was subsequently begun on
Bactrim and steroids.  Soon after bactrim administration the
patient stopped spiking fevers, however she persisted with low
oxygen saturation and required 6L O2 by nasal cannula.  The
patient's O2 saturation ranged from 89-94%, and appeared to
improve with lasix administration.  She occasionally required
masked ventilation to maintain O2 saturation over 90%.  After
six days of bactrim therapy, her bactrim was discontinued out of
concern that it was contributing to the patient's neutropenia.
Primaquine and clindamycin were begun instead.  Her neutrophil
count slowly increased over a period of four days from 40 to
170, she remained afebrile, but her oxygenation did not improve.
 On [**10-12**] the patient was transferred back to the ICU after
having another acute oxygen desaturation of 78% on 6LNC. Patient
was stabilized and transeferred back to the floor on NRB 100%,
she continued on IV antibiotic regimen of meropenem and Bactrim.
She remained afebrile and was continued on Bactrim and
voriconazole. She was able to be weaned to 99% on 3L nasal
cannula prior to discharge. Her prednisone dose was tapered, she
was discharge on Prednisone 30mg AM, 10mg PM per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] who
will follow her at the rehabilitation facility. Given her risk
of GIB it was very important to taper her steroid dose.

# MDS: The patient is s/p decitabine treatment from [**9-12**], and
gradually became neutropenic.  While in the hospital her
cyclosporine was discontinued.  She was administered neupogen
and her counts eventually recovered slowly. Her last ANC on the
day of discharge was 3100. Further treatment for underlying
disease at Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] discretion.

# Hyponatremia: Urine electrolytes consistent with SIADH, likely
from the pulmonary process. She was fluid restricted to 1L, it
was diffucult to mantain this restriction given the IV
medications. Once she was taken off the IV meds her sodium level
rose, 130 upon dishcharge. She was continued on salt tabs.

#Sundowning: Her mental status would wax and wane at nighttime,
multifactorial etiology of undrlying infection, hypoxia,
hyponatremia and medications. Her medication list was reviewed
and with treatment of her underlying disease her mental status
improved. She was alert and oriented at discharge.
