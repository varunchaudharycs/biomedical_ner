History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with a history of Afib s/p
ablation,HTN,DM, spinal stenosis, with recent hospitalization
for osteomyelitis who presents with altered mental status and
worsening tremor.  She had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] following
hospitalization from presumed sepsis and hypotension on [**2125-11-5**]
to rehab. On the evening of [**11-9**] a moonlighter was called for
increasing agitation. It is unclear at what point she  received
0.5mg of ativan. The patient was confused (oriented x1) with  a
question of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with
AMS.
.
In ED tachy to 110s, SBP 110s and required a  0.7L fluid bolus
with resolution of BP to 130s, but remained tachy to low 100s. A
CT ab/pelvis revealed a fluid collection on her left flank. No
PE was noted. She continued to receive Vanc/flagyl and got a
dose of zosyn, with admission for further work up.
.
ROS was negative for chest pain, syncope or presyncope,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Patient did not have any other complaints. She reported
that her tremor has been present since she was in her 20s,
related to a medication effect.
.
This am on the floor she was intermittently oriented to place
and month but sometimes thinking she was stranded without her
car and needing help.  She did complain of anxiety once, calling
for help, and was verbally calmed down then noted to be
tachycardic to the 140s. Cardiology was consulted, with carotid
massage x 2 performed, with return to normal sinus rythm.

[**Name (NI) **] son notes that her speech is significantly more
garbled in the last two to three days than previously. She began
to have difficulty speaking status post extubation during the
previous ICU stay, but her speech has become progressively
worse. He confirms that the patient has had a baseline tremor,
thought to be due to a medication effect 20 years ago. By the
time the son visited the patient in the late morning, her tremor
had improved, though it did intermittently worsen when the
patient became more anxious.  Son also noted that pt had
intermittently stared off into space and been less responsive
for a few minutes, then would return to conversation.

Pertinent Results:
============
Radiology
============

CT Torso [**11-9**]
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality.
2. 2.2 x 2.0 cm fluid and air collection in the subcutaneous
tissues of the
left lateral abdominal wall that could reflect post-operative
seroma, but
abscess cannot be excluded.
3. No evidence large fluid collection surrounding spinal
fixation hardware in the lumbar spine, although artifact
obscures fine detail and evaluation is suboptimal.
4. Cirrhotic liver with ascites.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small
on the right
with adjacent atelectasis.
6. Atherosclerotic disease.

CT Head [**11-10**]
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion. Within this
limitation, no
acute intracranial abnormalities identified.

Repeat study [**11-10**]
Several rounded areas of hypodensity are seen within the left
frontal region seen on axial images only that are likely areas
of volume averaging, however, peripheral areas of infarction
cannot be entirely excluded, and if of clinical concern, a
repeat examination or MR can be
performed. No evidence of hemorrhage.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite acute infarction.
2. Mild-to-moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles, with
features as described above and slightly out of proportion to
the prominence of the cerebral sulci; while this can relate to
volume loss, associated communicating hydrocephalus/NPH cannot
be completely excluded. To correlate clinically

============
Neurology
============
EEG [**11-13**]
This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states.
Note is made by technician of intermittent left leg shaking
without obvious epileptiform discharges or EEG correlate seen
during that time. Due to technical difficulties, video was
unavailable for review. No focal, lateralized, or epileptiform
features were noted during this recording. Note is made of a
tachycardia of 108 bpm in a single EKG channel.

24 hour EEG [**11-18**]
This 24 hour video EEG telemetry capture no electrographic
seizures. There were no clear focal or lateralizing epileptiform
features. The background showed a slightly disorganized alpha
theta rhythm which would be normal for advanced age.

===========
Cytology
============
Pleural fluids [**11-14**]
 	 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

============
Cardiology
============

Stress test [**11-12**]
 No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes to
pharmacologic stress. Appropriate blood pressure response with
flat
heart rate response to Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent
separately.

TTE [**11-14**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the basal half of the inferior wall and mid-inferior septum and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-5**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is now improved. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old woman with a history of Afib s/p ablation, HTN, DM,
spinal stenosis, with recent hospitalization for osteomyelitis
who presents with altered mental status and worsening tremor.
She had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] following hospitalization from
presumed sepsis and hypotension on [**2125-11-5**] to rehab. On the
evening of [**11-9**] a moonlighter was called for increasing
agitation. It is unclear at what point she received 0.5mg of
ativan. The patient was confused (oriented x1) with a question
of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with AMS. On
the day of admission, patient was transferred to the MICU for an
episode of unresponsiveness on the floor. The patient rapidly
improved in regards to her mental status upon admission to the
MICU. CT head and MRI were negative, and Neuro felt this event
was likely toxic/metabolic in nature. She was called out to the
floor where an EEG was performed and negative. She underwent
diagnosistc thoracentesis which was transudative in nature on
[**11-12**]. Post-thoracentesis CXR detected a left hemidiaphagm and
repeat film several hours later was performed while the patient
was having another episode of shaking. She became unresponsive
and was noted to have shallow breathing. The xray technicians at
the patient's side were unable to palpate a pulse so CPR was
initiated and a code was called. Code team immediately noted
that patient was in A fib, and CPR was stopped. Patient at this
time was awake but delirious. Her oxygen saturation began to
plummet and decreased breath sounds were noted on the left side.
CXR revealed a large hydrothorax, and patient was transferred
back to the MICU. A chest tube was placed and blood tinged
sanguinous fluid returned. Patient was intubated for airway
protection.

Patient remained in the MICU from [**11-12**] through [**11-18**]. While in
the MICU she was extubated on [**11-14**]. She required pressors from
[**11-12**] through [**11-15**]. Her hypotension was felt to be due to
hypovolemia secondary to dramatic chest tube fluid output. Chest
tube drained between 2 and 4 L per day of ascitic fluid from
presumed hepatic hydrothorax. Cardiac enzymes were slightly
elevated, but consistent with her level of renal dysfunction and
was felt not to have ACS. She had several TTEs which showed
improving systolic function from EF 35 to 50%.  The patient
required 2 untis of PRBC transfusion in the unit and multiple
albumin bags for resuscitation. Thoracic surgery was consulted
on [**11-16**] for assistance on hydrothorax management, and they
advised no surgical intervention. Instead the chest tube was
placed to waterseal on [**11-17**] and diuresis was initiated with
lasix drip per thoracic surgery recommendations. A diaphragmatic
defect was not felt to be responsible. The patient was able to
maintain her pressures, and she tolerated diuresis with these
maneuvers. Her course in the MICU was also complicated by
intermittent episodes of sinus tachycardia to has high as 140s
bpm which responded transiently to carotid massage. Her sinus
tach was felt to be due to [**Last Name (un) 3041**] shifts and anxiety. She was
transferred out of the MICU on [**11-18**]. No clear cause for her
change in mental status was found while in the MICU. A repeat
EEG was again negative, and Neurology once again felt that this
was likely multifactorial toxic/metabolic insults in the setting
of acute on chronic renal failure, liver disease, chf, dm and
hypoxia from chronic pleural effusions.

Back on the medical floor, she continued to improve.

# Altered mental status: Her altered mental status was likely
related to medication side effects or hepatic encephalopathy.
Her Elavil was decreased for possible anticholinergic side
effects.  If her mental status worsens, suggest changing patient
over to nortripytline and checking levels.

# Tachycardia: Her sinus tachycardia improved after adding
metoprolol back to her medication regimen.

# Anemia: She had a hematocrit drop while in the MICU without
clear source and was guaiac negative. After 2 units pRBCs on
[**11-15**], her hematocrit was stable.

# Osteomyelitis: Patient is on long term vanco/metronidazole
since previous hospitalization for L2 osteo and is followed by
ID as an outpatient. She is to continue vancomycin until [**2125-12-16**]
and flagyl until [**2125-12-20**].

# Mild systolic congestive heart failure: She was diuresed as
above. Patient's most recent EF 50%.

# NASH Cirrhosis: She was seen by hepatology during this
admission.  She had a low MELD.  Patient was started on
aldactone and diuresed as above.  She is to follow-up with the
liver center as an outpatient.

# Inverted nipple noted on exam: Patient will need follow up
with PCP for this issue.

# DM: She was continued on an insulin sliding scale.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for confusion.  During your
hospital stay, you had 2 episodes of decreased responsiveness
prompting stays in the intensive care unit.  We suspect your
first episode was from medications causing sedation and that
your second episode was from difficulty breathing because you
had fluid accumulating around your left lung.  You improved
after draining the fluid with a cathether and taking medications
to clear the fluid from your body.  You were stable to be
discharged to a rehab facility to work on regaining your
strength.  Please follow-up with your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 40075**].

The following changes were made to your medications:
Decreased Elavil from 75mg to 25mg as it may have worsened your
confusion
Increased lasix to 60mg IV twice a day.  This will be tapered to
meet your goal Ins and Outs
Increased vancomycin to 750mg for therapeutic level
Decreased metoprolol from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
Started fluconazole 200 mg daily for fungus in your urine for 14
days (last day [**2125-12-8**])
Started Lactulose 30mg TID and aldactone to help control your
liver cirrhosis.
Started full dose aspirin for your atrial fibrillation
Stopped megace

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 40075**].  You can call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 40076**] to schedule an appointment.

Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the liver center.  You will
be called about appointment scheduling but if you do not hear
from them, please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1582**].
