# Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient presented with

from 29-->26, the patient had no evidence of hemodynamic
compromise.  The patient was started on an IV proton pump
inhibior and the gastroenterology service was contact[**Name (NI) **].  The
the patient underwent endoscopy which showed erosive gastritis
and deuodenitis.  Given the patient's history of chronic pain,

biopsy was obtained.  At the time of discharge, Anti-H.pylori

repeat endoscopy in [**1-22**] months.  She was to have a repeat
hematocrit check in 1 week.  She was strictly instructed to
avoid NSAIDs for pain control.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of
lightheadedness.
It was felt that your symptoms were due to blood loss from
bleeding in your stomach.  During this hospitalization, you
underwent an  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed an
ulcer and stomach irriation. From your history, this was most
likely caused by your daily use of ibuprofen.
.
Because of this irriation, you will need to take a medication
(Omeprazole) twice a day for at least 8 weeks-- this will allow
your stomach to heal.  It is highly recommended that you undergo
a repeat EGD in [**1-22**] months and that you no longer use ibuprofen
or other types of medications known as NSAIDS.  You may take
Tylenol as needed for pain but you should let your doctor know
if you need to take this on a regular basis.
.
Because of your bleeding, we also recommend that you follow-up
with your PCP as soon as possible for a repeat check of your red
blood count (Hematocrit) to make sure you have no further
evidence of bleeding.
.
Your blood pressure was normal this hospitalization, we
recommend that you do not continue to take your blood pressure
medication (Lisinopril) until you see your primary care
physician.
.
Please call your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if
you develop more lightheadednedd, shortness of breath, chest
pain, abdominal pain, increased darkened stools, black or tarry
stools or any other symptom of concern.
