Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest; transferred for cooling protocol

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD (defibrillator) placement [**2119-2-17**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 yo male who was working on a construction site and
was witnessed to fall from a standing position and lose
consciousness. He was also reported to have ?seizure activity.
Bystanders found him to be unresponsive/pulseless and initiated
CPR for 10 minutes. EMS arrived and found him to be in VF arrest
which was converted to sinus with 1 shock. He was intubated on
the field and transferred to [**Hospital6 **]. On arrival he
was unresponsive; and shortly went into PEA arrest and was
?shocked? x 1 with resolution to sinus tach with LBBB.
.
He was taken to the cath lab which showed 100% RCA and 100% LCx;
LAD 20% lesion which appeared "chronic"; EF 15%. When they tried
to cross 1 lesion his HR increased to 180's ?VT; he was shocked
with 200J x [**Street Address(2) 70830**] at 120's; he was also
hypertensive to the 200's which was treated with ?nitro drip. At
[**Hospital6 **] he received 600cc IVF; 325cc IV contrast;
10mg ativan.
.
Post-cath he was noted again to have seizure-like activity
(unsure of character) and was given 10mg ativan and taken to CT
scan which was preliminarily read as negative (although on
review here may be c/w sub-arachnoid hemorrhage)
.
On [**Hospital **] transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] he was noted to have decerebrate
posturing and L-turning of head.


Past Medical History:
HTN
heavy alcohol abuse-[**1-20**] vodka every day until 5 days PTA.


Social History:
very heave alcohol abuse. In [**Month (only) **] started to drink about [**1-20**]
vodka/day until 5 days prior to admission; 2ppd smoker; +MJ,
?cocaine; construction worker

dolls-head


Pertinent Results:
[**2119-2-8**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study due to
patient motion. Allowing for this, no evidence of intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage.
.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1255**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at 9:40 p.m.
on [**2119-2-8**]. The outside hospital CT scan was obtained on hard
copy, and will be brought to the file room in the morning.
Review of that examination at the time of attending review does
show increased density of the tentorium, which presumably
relates to the large volume of IV contrast used for what
apparently was a cardiac catheterization at that facility, which
also resulted in visualization of the vascular tributaries of
the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] on this [**Hospital3 **] CT scan. This tentorial
enhancement is no longer seen, likely due to the renal excretion
of the contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
.
[**2119-2-8**] CXR: 1. Successful intubation.
2. Diffuse bilateral hazy ground-glass opacities. This is
nonspecific, and may represent diverse etiologies depending on
the patient's clinical situation, e.g. aspiration, hemorrhage,
or PCP if the patient is immunocompromised. Followup is
recommended.
.
[**2119-2-10**] CXR: Since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube
and nasogastric tube have been removed. There has been no
significant change since the prior film of six hours previous.
The cardiomegaly, effusions, and some edema are still present.
.
IMPRESSION: Cardiac failure persists.
.
[**2119-2-10**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing sinus
rhythm is now present.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) VF arrest/rhythm: Most likely a primary arrthymic event
(based on story of falling, pulseless with CPR for 10min, and
Vfib when EMS arrived) and secondary to ischemic scar from old
infacts.  Does not appear to be ACS (low level CE, stenosis on
cath appeared old).  ECGs during hospitalization showed sinus
rhythm/sinus tach with LBBB (no old ECGs for comparison).  He
was loaded with amiodarone and maintained on metoprolol for rate
control.  He was monitored on telemetry and had no further Vfib
events; rhythm strips obtained from EMS and the outside hospital
did not capture any v-fib events. He had an ICD implanted on
[**2119-2-17**] and tolerated the procedure well.  He will follow up in
device clinic on [**2119-3-1**].
.
#) CAD/Ischaemia: He was taken for cardiac catheterization and
was found to have RCA and LCx occlusion which was thought to be
likely chronic. CE's were trended and peaked at low level
(likely related to post-code and not consistent with ACS).  He
was continued on aspirin, and was titrated up on metoprolol.  A
statin was not started right away given his elevated LFTs, but
once these normalized, he was started on a reduced-dose statin
(20mg atorvastatin)
.
#) Pump: Cath report showed an EF 15%; Multifactorial; ?acute
post code shock, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ?alcoholic
cardiomyopathy. Hopefully he will recover some function.  A
repeat echo showed an EF of 20-25% with no major valvular
abnormalities.  He will need another echo in approximately one
month to assess for recovery of his systolic function.
.
# fevers: He spiked fevers up to 102. He was initially started
on levo/metronidazole and vanco before a known source was found
to cover for likely aspiration pneumonia and line infections.
He was then found to have strep pneumo in his sputum and
continued to spike fevers until he was stabilized on an
antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  There was also
concern that these fevers might be related to alcohol withdrawl
and/or drug fever (from phenytoin, which was stopped on [**2-13**]).
He completed a five day course of azithromycin and his
ceftriaxone will be converted to cefpodoxime to complete a
10-day course.
.
#) Altered mental status/EtOH withdrawl: This has a
multifactorial origin: VF arrest, EtOH, sedation now. Per his
sister (whom he lives with) that he drank about [**1-20**] vodka per
night for 4 months and then stopped abruptly ~4 days prior to
admission.  Neurology was consulted especially given question of
seizure activity at the OSH.  An EEG was negative for seizures
and an LP showed normal cell count, protein, and glucose with no
evidence of infection.  A psychiatry consultation was obtained
and they believed that his prolonged delirium may have been
benzodiazepine intoxication.  He was maintained on standing
Haldol and only short-acting benzo's (lorazepam) were used for
his CIWA scale and his mental status gradually improved.  He
worked with PT/OT to regain strength, balance, and functioning
prior to discharge.
.
#) Transaminitis: Patient has mildly elevated alt > ast. GGT
mildly elevated as well. Most likely secondary to mild shock
liver in setting of code. Underlying liver disease from h/o
recent heavy EtOH use, high triglycerides (150) could put him at
risk for more damage.  His acetaminophen use was limited to
2g/day and he was eventually started on a reduced dose of
atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia.
.
#) Elevated Cr: Initially had some ARF which was most-likely
ATN/hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest. He was hydrated and
received mucomyst for cath.  His Cr trended down and recovered.
.
#) FEN/GI: He was given protonix for GI ppx given alcohol use.
He was also ordered for a speech and swallow eval after
extubation given his still "cloudy" mental status to assess risk
for aspiration.  He eventually passed a speech and swallow
study, though was recommeded to have close supervision with
meals given his distractability.  Heart healthy low sodium diet.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a cardiac arrest.  You
had a defibrillator implanted to help keep your heart beating
properly and prevent against such an arrhythmia.

You were found to have severe disease of your coronary arteries
(the arteries that supply your heart with oxygen).  For this,
you should take one aspirin daily for the rest of your life.
You were also started on medication for your cholesterol and
blood pressure.  You are also finishing a course of antibiotics
(cefpodoxime) for a possible pneumonia.

In order to optimize the health of your heart, you should
completely avoid both cigarettes and alcohol.  In order to help
you decrease your craving for cigarretes, you have been
prescribed the nicotine patch.  Do NOT smoke and have the patch
on at the same time.  You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Name (NI) 2411**] [**Name (NI) 51086**] to
talk with you about support systems to help avoid alcohol.

If you experience loss of consciousness, chest pain, high
fevers, or other concerning symptoms, you should seek medical
attention.
