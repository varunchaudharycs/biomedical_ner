weeks ago s/p surgery, esophageal cancer s/p resection,
chemotherapy and XRT, CAD who presented with one weak of
increased weakness, sob and pneumothorax and decreased mental

and related to weakness 2/2 MG, diaphragmatic weakness which
would not allow him to blow off CO2. He was also found to have a
new right apical pnuemothorax of unclear etiology but without
signs of tension pneumothorax on imaging or exam.  The family
and patient declined thoracocentesis. The patient was dyspneic
and did not tolerate BiPAP. His code was changed from DNR/DNI to
comfort measures only per his health care proxy.  The patient
died on [**2103-10-19**] at 9:15am secondary to respiratory failure
secondary to diaphragmatic weakness/pneumothorax secondary to
