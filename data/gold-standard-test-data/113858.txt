History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old man with history notable for extensive
pulmonary asbestosis, atrial fibrillation, and RP fibrosis s/p
ureterolysis and omental wrap who presented to an outside
hospital on [**2196-10-26**] for elective hernia repair.   The patient
has long been awaiting repair of a large inguinal hernia and
ventral hernia and had stopped taking his coumadin 10 days prior
to presentation (he is on this for atrial fibrillation) in order
to get these procedures completed.  Over the week prior to
presentation he had also noted worsening left lower extremity
edema and increasing abdominal girth with worsening of his
preexisting vental hernia.   Other review of systems notable for
some nonproductive cough as well as general fatigue and
decreased mobility for the past month, which he largely
attributed to his impressive hydrocele.  He denied any
fevers,chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.

At the outside hospital initial evaluation revealed abdominal
wall erythema concerning for cellulitis as well as a swollen
left lower extremity.   Ultrasound showed left common femoral
vein DVT.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On arrival he complained of fatigue and discomfort from his
large hernias.  No other issues.

Past Medical History:
-asbestosis
-atrial fibrillation
-ureterolysis
-RP fibrosis (presumed idiopathic)
-omental wrap


Social History:
The patient worked as a steam engineer for over 40 years.  He
reports significant asbestos exposure over a period of several
years.  He lives with his wife of 58 years.  He denies TOB or
drug use and says he drinks alcohol only very occasionally.

===============
OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG [**2196-10-26**]:
Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast [**2196-10-26**]:
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1. Abnormal soft tissue encasing the retroperitoneal structures,
surrounding the aorta and IVC, extending inferiorly along the
presacral space. These findings are incompletely characterized
without intravenous contrast.  Findings could reflect
retroperitoneal fibrosis, though correlation with prior history
or any prior imaging would be helpful. The attenuation of this
material is not compatible with hemorrhage
2. Complex ventral abdominal wall hernia containing fat, fluid
and small
bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
3. Large left inguinal hernia, with herniation of fluid and
sigmoid colon to the left scrotal sac.
4. Large amount of ascites.
5. Left external iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral
venous
thrombosis.

Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Marked cardiac enlargement predominantly involving
the left heart. Extensive bilateral pleural changes including
calcifications consistent with previous asbestos exposure.
Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates upper zone re-distribution
pattern but no conclusive evidence for acute infiltrates.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2196-11-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the common femoral vein
extending into the greater saphenous and deep femoral veins. Of
note, the proximal extent of thrombus is not defined.
2. No right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

Spirometry [**2196-11-4**]:
Impression:
Marked restrictive ventilatory defect with a marked gas exchange
defect.
The reduced DLCO suggests an interstitial process. There are no
prior studies available for comparison.

TTE [**2196-11-4**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no VSD
seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Abdominal Ultrasound w/Dopplers [**2196-11-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal portal venous, hepatic venous, and hepatic arterial
flow to the
liver.
2. Large amount of ascites

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2196-11-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
The constellation of findings including an increasing right
pleural effusion which is moderately large, massive hiatal
hernia, diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs
probably infective or inflammatory, extensive calcification in
multiple pleural plaques with extensive intra- abdominal ascites
all contribute to the worsening respiratory status.
The presence of an increasing pleural effusion with calcified
and noncalcified pleural plaques in the setting of
asbestos-related disease raises the remote possibility of
mesothelioma.

TTE [**2196-11-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild concentric hypertrophy with normal
biventricular regional and global systolic function. Moderate
diastolic dysfunction with elevated PCWP. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-11-4**],
the findings are similar. A paramembranous VSD is not seen on
either study (mentioned in initial report). The velocity across
the aortic valve is now lower

CT Chest [**2196-11-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right-sided pleural effusion which has increased in
size since the
study performed five days prior. Associated compressive
atelectasis of the
right lung base. Also compressive atelectasis of the left lung
base due to
large hiatal hernia which is unchanged.
2. Scattered ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs,
stable, likely
infectious or inflammatory in nature. No focal consolidations.
No other
significant changes since the prior study.

Renal Ultrasound [**2196-11-12**]:
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Non-diagnostic Doppler evaluation
due to
patient's inability to hold breath.

CT Chest w/o Contast [**2196-11-14**]:
FINDINGS: There has been a slight decrease in size of the large
right pleural effusion since the previous CT on [**11-12**] with
no pneumothorax. The right lower lobe compressive atelectasis
remains similar and the large intrathoracic hiatal hernia now
contains peripheral fluid tracking up from the extensive
ascites. Otherwise, no change since the CT torso on [**2196-11-12**], and reference to the previous CT report is recommended for
complete description of findings.

KUB [**2196-11-25**]:
FINDINGS:
In the left anterior mid abdomen in the expected location of the
patients
known ventral abdominal hernia, multiple air-filled and dilated
bowel loops
are seen, likely involving both small and large bowel. Air is
visualized in
the rectum.  CT is recommended to rule out large or small bowel
obstruction.

Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-26**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is compared with
[**11-22**]
and [**2196-11-25**]. There is a large hiatal hernia. There is
increase in
the right mid lung opacification, which may be atelectasis or
pneumonia.
There is left basal atelectasis with increasing pleural
effusion. Within the left upper lung there is increased
opacification, which may be secondary to infection. The right
pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. There is
atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old male with history of paradoxical atrial
fibrillation, pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic RP fibrosis
presenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distension
found to have DVT and with progressive chylous ascites.

1)Chylous Ascites: The patient was noted to have a distended
abdomen on presentation and imaging revealed a large amount of
ascites.  As the patient had not had a previous history of
ascites this was worked up with liver ultrasound that revealed
no parenchymal or vascular dysfunction.  Diagnostic paracentesis
was obtained on [**2196-11-5**] that showed chylous ascites.  This
paracentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient was
empirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone though
he remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.  After the
chylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for a
malignancy given the lack of liver disease.  Multiple imaging
studies failed to show a mass,  however, multiple fluid
cytologies were negative, and the patient's LDH was within
normal limits making lymphoma quite unlikely.  Therefore, most
likely etiology of the development of chylous ascites was
thought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from RP fibrosis
leading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into the
peritoneal cavity.  The patient had three therapeutic
paracentesis on [**11-14**], and [**11-29**] respectively removing 900
cc, 3L and 1 L of chylous fluid respectively.  The second of
these revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second
course of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the
patient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured)
which completed on [**2196-11-29**].  All cultures remained negative.
Unfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax from
fluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratory
distress.  Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with
medical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low
fat TPN but these were unsuccessful.  General surgery was
consulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to
improve lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are
very small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely
be as damaging as initial insult.  Case was discussed with
thoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to
thoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management.
 Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed
extensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of
cisterna chyli.  Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been
required and given patient's progressively poor respiratory
status this would have required intubation.  As lymphangiogram
and balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of
success were not considered high and risk of intubation and
likely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and
patient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  The
possibility of disease modifying therapy for RP fibrosis was
discussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be no
role for the agents used (almost all of which are immune
suppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these things
would be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.

2) Chylothorax/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was
initially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desats
to the low 90's on room air.  He was seen by pulmonary who
attributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causing
restrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonary
asbestosis and plaques.  This was supported by his initial PFT's
that showed a restrictive pattern.  The patient then became
progressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding right
sided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressive
atelectasis.  He was desatting to the low 90's on 4L O2 by nasal
cannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [**2196-11-10**] with
considerable improvement after the procedure.  By [**11-12**], however,
he had reaccumulated almost completely and by [**11-13**] was
desaturating again so that an ABG showed of O2 of around 53.
Therefore, he was transferred to the unit while he awaited a
second thoracentesis.  As he reaccumulated quickly again after
that thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtail
catheter, which was placed on [**2196-11-15**].  Over the ensuing days
the patient continued to put out greater than one liter of
chylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the various
interventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fat
diets, octreotide, etc...).  On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was
attempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest
tube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very
low probability of being successful.  After the second
thoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4L of
oxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.  On [**11-26**] he
desaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening
infiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding
TPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume
overload. However, on the day of expected discharge ([**11-30**]), his
respiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% on
non-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask. Given that
comfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula,
and oxygen saturations were no longer followed.

3) Nutrition/Protein Loss: Initially the patient was allowed to
eat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he was
converted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made NPO with
TPN. Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall
presumably due to losses in the chest tube.   After he became
quite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal
reduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications
TPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for
comfort.  He and his family understand he will ultimately
continue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor
toleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered
acceptable by them.

4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to
have intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a
right upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent
sputum.  Therefore, he received 9 days of cefepime/vancomycin
with some improvement in his sputum production and stable chest
radiograph findings.  White count failed to trend reliably. He
was never febrile.

5) LLE DVT: He was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned to
be therapeutic on coumadin.  He was transferred back to heparin
gtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughout
his course there to make procedures feasible without needing a
long warfarin wash-out. Anticoagulation with medications other
than unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not
optimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.

6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of
penicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement
in his abdominal rash.  He then received 10 days of vancomycin
as well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal
rash could be a contact dermatitis.  This led to resolution of
his abdominal rash.

7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around
[**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his
trunk in the context of receiving a dose of
piperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.  This medication was stopped
an his rash resolved.

8) Hypotension: The patient developed relative hypotension in
the hospital.  Multiple blood cultures were negative and this
seemed stable without mental status changes or end organ
dysfunction (except some worsening of his CKD).  This was
thought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive third
spacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compression
of the IVC by his abdomen.

9) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline Cr is unclear.
At presentation Cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 before
trending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and his
general deterioration.  Renal was consulted twice and ultimately
concluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flow
from the heart in the context of his third spacing and massive
abdominal distension.  He never became oliguric or anuric.

10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal
agents were being held.  This broke with diltiazem and he was
restarted on this medication with good rate control.

11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family
and patient about the lack of options for reversing the
patient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent
respiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they
elected to pursue comfort focused care.  Reasonably benign
interventions (i.e. antibiotics, pleurodesis through a
preexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares
were not.  Similarly oral feeds were pursued even in the face of
a possible SBO for the patient's comfort and happiness.  His
major goal was comfort and the family and patient understood his
poor prognosis. When his respiratory status deteriorated on
[**11-30**] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were not
pursued, and he was given morphine. He passed away in the
evening of [**11-30**], and his family was notified. Autopsy was
requested and will be performed at [**Hospital1 18**].
