Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 82740**] is a 29 yo M, with acute on chronic renal failure on
HD and HTN controled on PO meds.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure, initiation of HD - His renal
failure appears to be of chronic etiology.  His symptoms,
including had leg swelling, mental status, and abdominal
pain/nausea have worsened over months to two years.  The urine
sediment anaylsis had very large waxy brown muddy casts,
consistent with a chronic renal failure picture in addition to
possible ATN that could have been induced in the setting of
NSAID use. Despite nephrotic range proteinuria, the patient does
not have clinically overt nephrotic stigma of diffuse edema.
.
Definitive diagnosis is to be made upon results of kindey biopsy
that was done the day prior to discharge. Prilimiary
differential is most likely for focal segmental glomulonephritis
given age, ethinithy, and severity of disease. However, all
hepatic and HIV serologies were negative. Second most likely
given the severity of the hypertension is hypertensive
glomulerosclerosis. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], HIV, hepatitis serologies
negative. Normal c3 c4 complement levels and normal SPEP. Urine
tox screen was negative.
.
Patient was receiving daily [**Doctor First Name 2286**] through a tunnelled HD line
at the time of discharge and was clinically stable. Patient did
not have any symptoms consistent with uremia - no more vague
abdominal symptoms, pericarditis, or altered mental status.
Patient was seen by nutrition regarding having a renal diet. At
the time of discharge, patient was making urine, around 100-200
cc/hr. Patient is to have [**Doctor First Name 2286**] here and to be followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] until outpatient [**Last Name (STitle) 2286**] is arranged. Hep B vaccine
was administered.
.
PPD placed LEFT volar forearm on [**909-4-21**], will be read in
[**Month Year 2286**] on [**4-23**].
.
# HTN - The chronological relationship to renal failure unknown,
but clearly made worse by declining renal function.  At the time
of discharge, the patient was normotensive with pressures of
121/65 on labetalol and amlodipine. Upon presentation to OSH
pressures were 230/130 suggesting a chronic hypertensive
picture. Patient says that he had seen a physician as an
outpatient within the past year, and was found to be
hypertensive and was started on presumably HCTZ, which the
patient was non-compliant. Once the results of the renal biopsy
are obtained, will consider starting ACEI.
.
# Hypertriglyergiemia - Could be elevated in the setting of
nephrotic disease. LDL was 130 and trigs 288. Patient was
started on simvastatin 10mg PO daily.
.
# Secondary Hyperparathyoidism in the setting of renal failure -
PTH elevated 561 suggesting a chronic renal failure picture. The
corrected calicium was 7 and the phos 5.8, suggesting that the
patient was severely nutritionally deficient. Patient was
started on Phos-Lo calcium acetate with meals.
.
#Abdominal pain - although CTA showed jejunal changes, benign
abdominal exam. The [**Doctor First Name 9189**] mesentery appears to be non-specific
edema in the setting of small ascities in a malnurished,
hypoalbuminemic, uremic patient. Uremia leads to inflammation
and can worsen the edema. The symptoms have resolved with the
initiation of [**Doctor First Name 2286**] and the patient at the time of discharge
did not have any nausea or vomitting. Phorphria was negative.
.
#Anemia - labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease, most
likely secondary to chronic renal failure. EPO being
administered with [**Doctor First Name 2286**] and patient being started on folate.
Normal ferritin levels. Red cell morphology normal, normal bili.
No evidence of hemolysis but elevated LDH.
.
# Elevated CK - appears idiopathic, and is in the 300-600 range
and not correlated clinically to a rhabdomylsis picture.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and severe
hypertension. You were started on [**Doctor First Name 2286**] for your renal
failure and are to continue [**Doctor First Name 2286**] here until your outpatient
[**Doctor First Name 2286**] is arranged. You hypertension was controlled intially
