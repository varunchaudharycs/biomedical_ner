History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old man with a history of COPD, CAD,
CHF who presents with respiratory failure, transferred from an
OSH.
.
Per the OSH records, patient had a gradual onset of shortness of
breath over the 24 hours prior to admission.  Also with cough;
no reported fevers or chills.
.
Per EMS report, "pt had been having difficulty breathing and
chest pain since yesterday which worsened this morning...Pt
states pain and difficulty breathing began at the same time...he
points just to the (R) of his sternum and on his sternum
mid-chest when asked for the location of the pain.  O2 sat 97%
on NRB."
.
Vitals at the OSH showed a temparature of 97.2, BP of 114/90, HR
90, RR 35 and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air.  Lungs
were reported as "diminished but clear".  The O2 deteriorated to
the 50s on 3 liters and the patient was intubated with a #8 ETT.
 Subsequently, blood pressure fell and dopamine was started.

All other Cx including blood, sputum, urine, pleural fluid were
negative

CXR [**5-4**]
There is new right IJ line with tip in the SVC. The pacemaker is
unchanged. ET tube tip is 6.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube
tip is not well visualized. The right-sided airspace opacities
are again visualized as is volume loss/infiltrate in the left
lower lobe. The CP angles are off the film, and thus difficult
to assess for effusion on this film. Overall with exception of a
new line, there has been no significant interval change

EKG on admission:
Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular premature beat and
probably two
ventricular paced beats. Since the previous tracing of [**2165-5-5**]
ventricular
pacing is new. The first paced beat appears early and may be
related to
a non-sensed ventricular premature beat. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2165-5-7**] at 3:05:11 PM
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50 %), most likely due
in part to the presence of reduced ventricular filling secondary
to atrial fibrillation with relatively rapid ventricular rate.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2165-5-12**] 2:49 PM

Cholelithiasis, and mild gallbladder wall thickening without
significant gallbladder distention. Wall thickening may be
secondary to underdistention of the gallbladder, or third
spacing. Given the minimal gallbladder distention, this is less
likely secondary to acute cholecystitis. Evaluation of the
common duct in the region of the pancreatic head is limited by
ultrasound technique.

US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT  [**2165-5-12**] 2:09 PM
Focused ultrasound scanning was performed in the area of the
patient's pacemaker in the right upper chest. Pacemaker leads
are identified in the subcutaneous tissues, and there is no
evidence of surrounding fluid collection or abscess.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-5-12**] 11:55 AM
No evidence of acute sinusitis

CT CHEST/ABD W/CONTRAST  [**2165-5-12**] 11:56 AM
1. There is no CT evidence of an inflammatory collection or an
inflammatory process in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis to explain
the patient's symptoms.

2. Bilateral bibasilar mild-to-moderate pleural effusion with
adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. No radiographic evidence of
pneumonia.

3. Ascites confined to the right upper quadrant with no
enhancing wall septations or loculations.

4. Sludge/stones in the gallbladder.

5. Cluster of calcification and hypodensity seen in the head and
uncinate process of the pancreas in close proximity may
represent a focus of chronic pancreatitis.

6. Equivocal filling defect in the lower CBD and prominant
appearance of the region of the papilla. As the patient has a
pacemaker, MR evaluation is precluded. ERCP may be useful for
further assessment/diagnosis as clinically dictated.

7. A complex cystic mass with solid enhancing rim is seen
arising from the left kidney suspecious for a renal cell
carcinoma. A targeted renal US should be confirmatory.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO: The patient was transferred intubated and sedated on the
ventilator. Throughout his hospital course, he had daily
wake-ups through the sedation and pain medication. Early in his
course, he awoke very agitated and not following commands,
though was alert, looking around the room and moving all
extremities with equal and reactive pupils. He had a history of
alcohol use, and had experienced DT's in the past with
withdrawal. Consequently, he was maintained on a versed drip and
much of the confusion was attributed to possible withdrawal in
addition to delerium. With re-evaluation by wake-ups, the
patient slowly became more attentive and did not have
tremors/shakes, was following commands and communicated that he
was not in any discomfort. After extubation, a full neuro exam
was normal including strength/sensation, cranial nerves, DTRs,
cerebellar exam and speech/memory.

HEENT: The patient was noted to have poor dentition, but no
signs of abscess/infection on oral exam. In addition, a CT scan
of his head was normal and showed no signs of sinusitis.

PULMONARY: His active problems during this admission were
respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusion. The main
concern for this patient was that of pneumonia, and strep
pneumonia grew in the first sputum culture on admission. He was
noted to have a large R pleural effusion, which was tapped, but
did not show evidence of empyema. He remained on the ventilator
for 17 days. Upon extubation, he did well, had minimal
secretions and strong cough, O2 sats in the 90's, work of
breathing was easy.

CARDIAC: Active issues during this admission included
hypotension and atrial fibrillation, with a history of CAD and
CHF.  The hypotension was not fluid responsive and he required
levophed pressor support for the first 15 days of
hospitalization. This was weened off and he was eventually
restarted on all of his home HTN medication. The hypotension was
felt to be sepsis physiology, without evidence of new mycardial
injury. The atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled, and at
first anticoagulation was held [**3-9**] a supratherapeutic INR. This
came down to normal levels, and a heparin drip was started and
he is being bridged back onto coumadin. In terms of his CHF, an
echo revealed only mildly depressed LVEF at 40-50%, and
specifics are listed in the report above.

GI/FEN: patient was aggressively volume resuscitated early on,
being at the highest 27 liters positive on his i/o's. This
eventually was diuresed to a slightly positive volume status,
and he will go to rehab with continued diureses. He was started
on tube feeds with help from the nutritionists, and will be
going to rehab taking PO.

RENAL/GU: The patient came to the service with mildly reduced
renal function. Upon receiving his CT his renl function
deteriorated and was felt to have contrast nephropathy. Over the
next week this resolved to his baseline.He responded well to
Lasix and metolazone diuresis as described above.

HEME/ID: Active issues included elevated INR (as described
above), and positive cultures included strep pneumonia on sputum
and 1/2 bottles of GPC bacteremia. His antibiotic course
intially was broad, including levaquin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin
and zosyn (broad plus double coverage). This was tailored down
to ceftriaxone  to cover the strep pneumonia that was speciated
from the sputum. The patient started requiring slightly higher
pressor support 1.5 weeks into admission, started spiking
nocturnal fevers, and subsequently grew the coag negative staph.
He was broadened again for this, though was felt this was likely
contaminant. His fever curve and white count normalized and the
course of antibiotics was d/c'd. He also developes some
diarrhea, but c.diff was negative x 3 (got PO flagyl until
negative cx came back)
Prophylaxis: remained on sch, then hep gtt/coumadin, pneumoboots
and PPi
Code: remained full code throughout
