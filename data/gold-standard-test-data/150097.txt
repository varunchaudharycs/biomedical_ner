History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] is a 66yo M with history of COPD on 2L home O2 and
hypertension who presented to his PCP's office with 12 days of
non-radiating substernal chest pain and worsening shortness of
breath.  He felt this pain may have been his GERD but did not
improve with tums.  At [**Company 191**] (his PCP's office), he was noted to
be look weak and an EKG was concerning for ? new
anterior-lateral changes.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98, 84, 136/88, 18, 96% 2L. On
arrival to ER, EKG was NSR without ST changes, and labs were
significant for trop of 0.31, platelets of 9, leukocytosis to 35
with 88% "other" cell types and hematocrit of 21.  Repeat EKG
was still non-ischemic and cardiology felt his troponins were
not due to active ischemia.  Given his platelets, there were no
plans for intervention.  Heme/onc was consulted to review his
smear given concern for acute leukemia.  Patient was given one
sublingual nitro and started on morphine for pain control.  He
was moving very little air on exam and felt to be having a COPD
exacerbation.  He was given solumedrol, ceftriaxone,
azithromyin, cefepime and albuterol/ipratropium nebs.  Patient
was transferred to the ICU for further management.  At time of
transfer, vitals were 98.7, 93, 150/68, 20, 94% 3L NC.

In the ICU, he endorses having had chest pain for the past
couple weeks that he felt was heartburn and epigrastric pain.
Over this time period, he has also had some generalized weakness
and cough productive of blood tinged sputum.  He feels his
scattered arm bruises are related to tripping and falling a few
days ago.

STUDIES:
NEOPLASTIC BLOOD  Date of [**2148-9-19**]
Karyotype: 47,XY,+8,t(15;17)(q22;q21.1)[2]
Only two metaphase cells were obtained and analyzed from
this specimen. This limited/ incomplete study may not rule
out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an
analysis. Two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome
8 (TRISOMY 8) and a TRANSLOCATION of chromosomes 15 and
17. This translocation is associated with PML-RARA fusion
and is a characteristic finding in acute promyelocytic
(M3) leukemia.
----------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300
CELLS-------------------
nuc ish(PML,RARA)x3(PML con RARAx2)[89/100]
FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed
on nuclei with the LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion
Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22
and RARA at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 89/100 nuclei, which exceeds
the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this
probe in our laboratory. A PML-RARA rearrangement is
found in most acute promyelocytic leukemias (FAB M3).
This test was developed and its performance
determined by the [**Hospital1 18**] Cytogenetics Laboratory
as required by the CLIA '[**25**] regulations. It has not
been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. This test is used for clinical
purposes.

FLOW CYTOMETRY:
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize blast yield.
Abnormal cells comprise 82% of total gated events.
B-cells comprise 6% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens.
T-cells comprise 57% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature
lineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of
1.04 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells
isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated
antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express
CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10
(cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14,
CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute
myeloid leukemia.  Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] promyelocytic
differentiation.  However, correlation with concurrent
cytogenetic findings is recommended for further
characterization.

IMAGING:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2148-9-20**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate to severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the
anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more
hypokinetic than the other walls) (LVEF = 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2146-5-26**], contractile function of both ventricles is now
significantly reduced.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   [**2148-9-23**] 6:31 PM
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right
frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass
effect. A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component is
also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional
non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. Given the
multifocality of these lesions, and history of malignancy, these
may represent metastases with associated hemorrhage. An
alternate consideration is multiple infarctions, some
hemorrhagic, likely embolic. MRI with and without contrast would
be helpful for further evaluation.

MRI BRAIN    [**2148-9-24**] 3:27 PM
CONCLUSION: Multiple acute areas of infarction, many with
hemorrhage. The
distribution suggests emboli from a proximal source, most likely
cardiac.
5-6 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The location of
the
hemorrhages does not imply prior bleeding from this aneurysm.
Within the limits of an adequate but not optimal MRA
examination, no other
intracranial vascular abnormalities are detected.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM   [**2148-9-25**] at 1:30:32 PM   Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. RV
hypokinesis is seen. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is small vegetation (4mm) on the mitral valve
attached to the posterior leaflet on the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Mild to
moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small vegetation of the mitral valve. Complex,
non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction.

CT HEAD    [**2148-10-1**] 8:28 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No interval change since [**2148-9-24**], with unchanged
appearance of
right frontal parenchymal hematoma with associated edema, local
mass effect
and stable degree of leftward shift of normally-midline
structures.
2. Hypodense lesions in the right occipital and parietal
occipital cortex
appear grossly unchanged but are not further characterized on
this motion-
degraded study.


LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**2148-10-3**] 1:45 PM
Findings:
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of right subclavian vein was
performed and
shows normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. Grayscale
and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of left subclavian, left internal jugular,
left axillary, left brachial, left basilic, and left cephalic
veins were performed. The left internal jugular vein shows
normal flow and augmentation.

There is abnormal flow in the left subclavian vein, left
axillary vein, and left basilic vein. Hypoechoic foci consistent
with clots are also clearly visualized in the left basilic and
left axillary veins. These findings are consistent with an upper
extremity thrombus in the left subclavian vein, left axillary
vein, and left basilic vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new
diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**]
with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple
strokes, and endocarditis.

# APML: Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was diagnosed with APML by peripheral smear,
flow cytometry, and PCR of the blood. He was treated with ATRA
and hydroxyurea initially and when his WBC was <10K, his
hydroxyurea was stopped. He also received steroids initially for
prophylaxis of ATRA syndrome and this was gradually weaned. He
was monitored for tumor lysis and DIC and transfused blood
products prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and INR <1.5. His
platelet goal was initially 20K but this was increased to 100K
after his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

# NSTEMI with new heart failure (EF 35%): Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] initially
presented to his PCP's office with chest pain. He had elevated
troponins on admission with no ST or T wave changes on EKG, c/w
NSTEMI. We trended his troponins which plateaued at 3.50. His
first ECHO showed moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum,
anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the
other walls) and LVEF = 30 %. He was monitored on telemetry and
had no significant arrhythmias. Given his concurrent IPH (see
below), antiplatelet & anticoagulant agents are contraindicated
and he was medically managed with nitrates, beta-blockers,
low-dose ACE-i and a statin. Repeat ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a
persistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex,
non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).

# Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: On the morning of [**2148-9-23**], it
was noted that Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was not moving his L arm. CT head
showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal
lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect. A
hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component was also
seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional
non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. MRI/A on
[**2148-9-24**] revealed multiple areas of acute infarction, many with
hemorrhage, with a distribution that suggests emboli from a
proximal source, likely cardiac. Unclear etiology for embolism ??????
blood cultures are negative to date to assess for bacteremia.
TEE showed aortic plaque that could be potential embolic source.
 MRA showed a 5-6mm communicating artery aneurysm as well.
Neurosurgery had no plans for intervention. Neurology was
consulted & recommended EEG which showed a diffuse
encephalopathy pattern and a focal area with epileptogenic
potential, but no electrographic seizures. All
antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents were held.  DIC labs were
stable, with a platelet count goal of >100K. He was able to be
extubated on [**2148-9-27**] and PT/OT was consulted for help
managing/recovering from his stroke. He continued to suffer from
mood lability on the floor and intermittently refused his
medications. Neurology continued to follow him. EEG was repeated
and did not show any seizure activity, just a diffuse
encephalopathy. Haldol 0.5mg IV was used [**Hospital1 **] prn for mood
stabilization as he refused.

# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: On presentation, he was hypoxic
and required oxygen support by nasal cannula (up to 6L). It was
felt to be multifactorial, with his underlying emphysema, acute
systolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia
contributing. Following his IPH, he was intubated for airway
protection on [**2148-9-20**] with successful extubation on [**2148-9-27**].
Bronchoscopy on [**2148-9-26**] showed edematous airways with
friability but no frank blood. BAL grew yeast (it was initially
reported as mold, concerning for Aspergillus, but
galactomannan/glucan were normal and it was re-read as yeast).
He is s/p 8 day course of cefepime and levofloxacin for his
pneumonia. Following extubation, he was maintained on his home
COPD medications and was maintaining stable O2 sats on room air.


# Culture-negative endocarditis:  ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a
small vegetation on mitral valve.  Unclear if this is infectious
versus malignant.  Added vancomycin (d1=[**9-25**]) for MRSA
endocarditis coverage and started ceftriaxone (d1=[**9-27**]).  Had
abdominal CT [**2148-9-26**] which did not show any infectious source.
Per ID, 6 week course of antibiotics recommended.

# LUE edema: LUE>RUE edema, of hand and arm. Patient had PICC
placed in left arm [**2148-9-27**] and his edema was concerning for
DVT. Given his recent IPH, anticoagulation was not an option.
Left upper extremity U/S done on [**2148-9-27**] to r/o DVT was
negative. Edema and pain persisted, so a repeat LUE U/S was done
on [**2148-10-3**] and showed extensive DVT of the L subclavian,
axillary and basilic vein. The PICC line was removed on [**2148-10-3**]
and a peripheral IV was placed.

On [**2148-10-4**], the family expressed a desire to transfer his care
to [**Hospital1 2025**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (NI) 653**] the inpatient hematologic malignancy
team who accepted the patient in transfer.
