Admisson CXR:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Lungs are clear. There is no
consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Trace pleural
thickening is seen in the major fissure on lateral film, likely
right sided. A small calcified nodule in the right mid lung
likely reflects a granuloma. Hilar and cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. The aorta is tortuous. There is no
evidence for volume overload. There is degenerative change in
the thoracic spine, with unchanged wedge deformity of a mid
thoracic vertebral body. There are no suspicious lytic or
sclerotic osseous lesions.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Unchanged degenerative change with wedge deformity of a mid
thoracic
vertebral body.

EKG: reviewed - sinus tach - no acute ST/TW changes, old LAD,

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo Iranian (farsi speaking) male with h/o COPD (on home o2
(uses 2-3h qdaily of home o2 overall), HTN, restless leg
syndrome, BPH transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

# Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure:
# Acute COPD exacerbation
He presented to the ED with shortness of breath and change in
mental status.  He was admitted to the floor for ARF and COPD
exacerbation.  He then develooped AMS and and decreased
respiratory rate with a gas of 7.16/105/69.  This was thought to
 be secondary to methadone overdose due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs rather than 5mg
tabs from his pharmacy.  He required BiPAP the first day in the
ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was started on
a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.  His
narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert
and speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan
while in the ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless
leg syndrome.  He was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which
was continued x2 days, then transitioned to prednisone. He was
also started on azithromycin.  [**4-9**] his home dose of methadone
was restarted 15mg PO BID.  Pt is on 2L oxygen at home but taken
off oxygen this AM with goal O2 sat 88-92% as likely is chronic
CO2 retainer. Patient??????s mental status is at baseline now
oriented to self and yr by his calendar, confirmed with family
that his mental status is good.

He was given Rx for albuterol MDI and is to continue his home
inhalers as well.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure ?????? appeared pre renal in
etiology, now resolved.
He is to continue his home Tamsulosin and Finasteride, lasix.

# Restless Leg syndrome ?????? See above patient may have
accidentally overdosed on his methadone.  His mental status
responded to a narcan gtt.  He was given prn fentanyl until [**4-9**]
at which point he was restarted on his home methadone 15mg PO
BID.  Emphasized appropriate dosing to pt, family, and have set
up VNA services to ensure he understands his medication.

# Anemia, microcytic - has h/o thalessemia. HCT stable during
admission.

# Code status: he did not require intubation and family reports
he does not have any history of COPD hospitalizations.  Code
status is full, but his providers did discuss with family the
possibility of a comfort-focused, noninvasive approach when he
was very ill in the unit.  Recommend that further goals of care
discussion continue with his PCP.
