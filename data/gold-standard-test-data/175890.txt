                            **FINAL REPORT [**2194-7-9**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2194-7-9**]):    NO GROWTH.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient was transfered for
cardiac catheterization. Although the patient was found to have
90% PDA lesion, her symptoms and stress test were unclear. It
was thought that the patient could benefit from medication
managment of CAD with ASA, increased statin and addition of
betablocker.  Therefore, she did not undergo repeat cardiac
catheterization. Plavix was stopped. If she does develop more
chest pain in the future, she could have further optimization of
anti-anginal medications and then undergo repeat stress testing.

.
# Agitation/Altered Mental Status: Patient became agitated in
the pre cath area and was given multiple doses of haldol. This
agitation was attributed to delirium [**3-11**] UTI. She was
transferred from the CCU to the medicine service on [**2194-7-5**].
She did well with the resolution of her UTI.
.
She was started on nighttime Zyprexa which we should be stopped
in two weeks.
.
#HCT Drop: Thought to be [**3-11**] Groin oozing into her leg.  Bedside
doppler was negative for pseudoanneurysm and there were no
bruits on exam.  Her HCT stabilized.  This was complicated by
iron deficiency anemia, for which she was started on iron with
vitamin C.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection:  At the outside hospital prior to
transfer, she was noted to have a Proteus UTI, and was started
on levofloxacin on [**2194-6-30**], switched to ceftriaxone on [**7-1**],
then to ciprofloxacin on [**7-3**], based on culture data.  While
here she was treated with ciprofloxacin, initially IV due to
agitation, and later with PO.  She completed her course in house
.
# s/p Arthroscopy:  Patient had R knee arthroscopy at [**Hospital3 12748**] in [**4-16**] per her daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] right knee was
initially noted to be more swollen than the left, but with no
obvious effusion.  She was given one dose of vancomycin,
ultimately, her right knee did not appear infected w/o small
amount of suprapatellar swelling but no effusion, warmth or pain
on movement. Vancomycin was discontinued.
