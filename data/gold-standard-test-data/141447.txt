Chief Complaint:
Transfered for w/u for surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysm.  No
surgery indicated.  Pt tx'd to ICU for syncope.

None

History of Present Illness:
74 yo c hx of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p RCA stent
[**2-26**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and aortic root aneurysm
who developed intermittent periods of lightheadedness over the
last month. He reports feeling dizzy with vague symptoms of
vertigo; these occured at random without association with
positional changes. He does not describe a clear prodrome to
these episodes. Had CT of chest to workup these symptoms and
noted to have significant coronary calcifications.
Catheterization showed distal RCA occlusion stented. Following
cath, had episodes of dizziness, now accompanied with some
confusion to orientation quickly clearing. Admitted to OSH with
persistent symptoms and noted to have orthostatic hypotension;
continued to have symptoms c fluid resuscitation and w/u for
adrenal insufficiency initiated. Started on fludricortisone at
OSH. Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation of aortic root
aneursym and medical evaluation of orthostatic hypotension.
.
In CSRU, had SBP to 160s and started on nitroglycerin drip; no
dissection noted and no emergent surgery performed. Morning of
transfer, pt. had episode of questionable loss of consciousness
while rising from a seated position to urinate. Arose from bed,
stood up at side of bed to urinate, had dizziness/vertigo, fell
to bed c no trauma to head. Found unresponsive briefly and noted
to have decreased respirations; bag valve mask used briefly and
pt. returned to [**Location 213**] respirations. Nitro drip stopped. Sinus
rhythm in 50s and SBP 112/60. Underwent ECHO showing normal
valvular function and transfered to medical ICU.

OTHER DATA:
[**3-27**] ECHO -
1.The left atrium is elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.

3. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 4. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
5.The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
7. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-26**] CT
1. Right hypodense subcentimeter renal structure, that may
represent a cyst, but a comparison with outside CTs is
recommended. Alternatively, an MR can be performed to evaluate
this lesion.
2. Densely atherosclerotic aorta, but no evidence for acute
aortic injury. Within the distal aorta is a very small focal
area of dilation with a possible ulcerated plaque.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF OVERVIEW: 74-year-old male xfr'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for eval for CT
[**Doctor First Name **] for aortic aneurysm but not a current candidate.  Had a
syncopal episode in the CSRU and transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  On
history, he was found to have had orthostatic symptoms at home
over the past ~1 month since starting flomax.  He had self d/c'd
this medication and felt better.  He was on nitro gtt in the
CSRU and was urinating when his syncope occurred there.  On xfr
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he had mild orthostatic hypotension that was
symptomatic originally, but asx after a fluid bolus of 1L.  The
following day he was symptom free.  The leading dx for his
syncope was felt to be medication effect from
flomax/nitroglycerin.  Other diagnostic possibilities included
bradycardia (? [**12-25**] amiodarone), volume depletion, vasovagal
syncope (micturition).  Adrenal fxn was found to be normal on a
cosyntropin stim test.  He was felt to be stable at this point
in the workup and was transferred to the medical floor for
further workup.  On the floor, the following problems were
addressed.
.
1. Dizziness - His dizziness was worked up as above in the ICU.
He had a normal ECHO w/out significant valvular disease and was
monitored on telemetry w/out events noted.  He was able to
ambulate w/out any problems on the floor and was d/c on the day
after admission [**12-25**] patient request.  Further diagnostic
possibilities that could be followed up as an outpatient
include: 1) CT/MRI of head to exclude stroke in setting of
stenting of calcific coronary arteries 2) tilt table test 3)
Neurological evaluation for more rare causes such as shy [**Last Name (un) **]
syndrome.
.
2. CAD - continued [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] in setting of recent RCA
stenting.  held off on bblocker or ace considering his
orthostatic hypotension but these could be considered as an
outpatient if his symptoms resolve
.
3. Afib - should be on coumadin based on ACC recommendations;
defer decision to anticoagulate to PCP
.
4. Aneurysm - evaluated by surgery and decided to not pursue
surgery at this time.
