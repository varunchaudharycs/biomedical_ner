Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
presenting for elective surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy
endotracheal intubation
central venous catheter placement
arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old female, with no significant past
medical history, recently referred to gynecology-oncology for a
diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She initially presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath.
She also reported a 20-30 pound weight loss, gradual abdominal
distention and bilateral lower extremity swelling.  She was
found to have a large right pleural effusion and underwent a 2.5
L thoracentesis, with negative cytology. The patient also had a
paracentesis with negative cytology at the OSH. CT torso on [**10-20**]
showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy,
ascities, and ovarian masses.  Ultrasound on [**2107-10-21**] showed
bilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normal
uterus. CA-125 was elevated at greater than 2500. She was then
transferred to the gyn-onc service for further management.
.
Patient underwent TAH/BSO, and ascites drainage.  Right pelvic
lymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to be
consistent with lymphoma.  The right ovarian mass was found to
be benign.  Multiple enlarged lymph noes were found, the largest
was over 5 cm.  Intraoperatively, she received 1 L IVF and was
bolused subsequently for low UOP and for post-operative
hypotension.     Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing
treatment.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was intubated and mildly
sedated, VS: BP 84/52 MAP 65 HR 88 O2 sat 95% on AC. Central
line was placed under ultrasound guidance in the right IJ.
While in the ICU, she was put on up to 3 pressors for her
hypotension.  She went into acute renal failure (thought to be
from hypotension-related ATN with a possible component of tumor
lysis syndrome from steroid-induced lysis) requiring CVVH and
rasburicase.  She was successfully taken off CVVH and extubated.
 She was diuresed aggressively for a 20L net positive fluid
status since her ICU admission.  Her abdominal wound was
draining up to 1L/day.  Also while in the ICU, she was noted to
have an EF of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an MI in the
setting of hypotension or if it is just "shocked" myocardium.
.
After her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferred
to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for further management.

Social History:
The patient smoked one pack per day for 30 years, but currently
does not smoke. She drinks occasionally. She is married and has
two daughters and one son from a previous marraige.

CT scan [**2107-11-4**] for lymphoma staging:
There is mildly heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with a
small 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe. There are
multiple nodes present within the mediastinum, the largest of
which is seen within the paraesophageal space measuring 16 mm in
diameter. There are bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes which
cannot be definitely measured given lack of IV contrast. There
is marked axillary lymphadenopathy with a representative node on
the right measuring 20 x 18 mm and is seen on series 2, image 6.
A representative node within the left axilla is seen on series
2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm. There are multiple tiny
nodules seen within the breasts bilaterally, the largest on the
left hand side measuring 12 x 15 mm, seen on series 2, image 16.
There are bilateral large pleural effusions. The lungs are
otherwise clear. Along the right thorax just below the scapula,
there is a moderate amount of air within the subcutaneous and
intramuscular space, probably sequelae from prior thoracentesis.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is a 27 x 15
mm node along the right pericardium measuring 15 x 27 mm, seen
on series 2, image 36. The patient is intubated and has a
nasogastric tube extending with tip in the post-pyloric region.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate amount of
ascites. The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder wall is
thickened likely secondary to third spacing. The pancreas is not
clearly defined but appears grossly unremarkable. The spleen is
prominent, slightly displacing the stomach medially 12 x 7 cm.
The adrenal glands are not well visualized secondary to an
extensive amount of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending
from the level of the SMA inferiorly and encasing the aorta and
IVC. A representative size of this conglomeration is seen on
series 2, image 74 measuring 86 x 52 mm. There is extensive
lymphadenopathy within the mesentery with a conglomerate of
nodes measuring 57 x 40 mm, seen on series 2, image 85. There is
a moderate amount of ascites. The small and large bowel are
unremarkable and opacified with oral contrast extending to the
rectum. There is no evidence of obstruction.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is catheterized.
The rectum is unremarkable. The uterus is not well visualized.
There are no adnexal masses with the exception of extensive
lymphadenopathy that extends into the deep pelvis bilaterally
inferiorly from the above-mentioned retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy along the iliac nodal chains. The largest bulk
of this lymphadenopathy measures 94 x 47 mm along the left iliac
nodal chain seen on series 2, image 105. There is extensive
inguinal lymphadenopathy, the largest nodal conglomerate seen on
the left measuring 49 x 62 mm.

Also noted within the subcutaneous tissue in the midline of the
abdomen are a few pockets of air seen along a linear soft tissue
defect likely secondary to prior surgical intervention.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
.
Echo ([**2107-11-2**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the
ventricle. Basal
segments contract well. The apex is milldy aneurysmal and
akinetic, but no
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the
apex is
trabeculated. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is
focal
akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall. The aortic
valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Repeat echo prior to R-CHOP ([**12-5**]): The left atrium is normal in
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the
ventricle. Basal segments contract well. The apex is milldy
aneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal akinesis of
the apical half of the RV free wall. The aortic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Abdominal Ultrasound ([**11-24**]): There are again identified
bilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged. There is a
moderate-to-large amount of ascites present in all four
quadrants, best appreciated in the left lower quadrant. In the
left lobe of the liver there are two uniformly hyperechoic
lesions, the largest of which measures 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm with
appearance consistent with hemangiomas. No other focal
abnormalities are demonstrated within the liver. The gallbladder
is collapsed with likely wall thickening again, which could be
secondary to third spacing of fluid. A shadowing gallstone is
demonstrated within the gallbladder lumen. The spleen is stable
in size measuring 11 cm in its longest length. A small roughly 1
cm anechoic lesion, without blood flow is demonstrated within
the spleen, not fully characterized on this study, though
possibly a cyst. The previously described extensive mesenteric
or retroperitoneal adenopathy is not well assessed on this
study.

Color flow and Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature was
performed given history of ascites. The hepatic veins, hepatic
arteries main portal vein and its branches are patent with
appropriate direction of flow and normal waveforms. The inferior
vena cava is generally narrowed without intraluminal filling
defects. This appearance could be secondary to fluid status or
secondary to ascites.
.
CTA ([**12-2**]):
 1. There is a large right pleural effusion with complete
passive collapse of the right lung. There is a small left
pleural effusion.
2. Again seen is mediastinal and pericardial lymphadenopathy,
which is not significantly changed in comparison to the prior
study.
3. A large amount of ascites.
4. Three hypodensities are seen within the visualized portion of
the liver which are not completely characterized.
.
.
CYTOLOGY:
Pleural Fluid: By immunohistochemical stains, the lymphocytes
are a mixture of CD20 positive B-cells along with CD3 positive
(B greater than T). Although definite co-expression of CD5
amongst B-cells could not be discerned, a subset of weak CD5
expressing cells is seen amongst the brighter CD5 positive
T-cells.  Scattered CD10 positive lymphocytes are seen.
Bcl-1/cyclin D1 is expressed in a minor subset.

Overall, the findings indicate involvement by the patient's
known Mantle cell lymphoma.

Peritoneal Fluid: Three color gating is performed (light scatter
vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. Abnormal/lymphoma cells
comprise 5% of lymphoid gated events.

B cells demonstrate a monoclonal Lambda light chain restricted
population.  They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 along with
CD5 and FMC-7.  They do not express any other characteristic
antigens including CD10, CD23. A subset express CD20.
T cells express mature lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION
Findings are of involvement by a Lambda restricted, CD5-positive
B cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immunophenotypically
consistent with patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.  Given the
small percentage of involved B-cells, peripheral blood
contamination cannot be ruled out.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. See HPI for MICU course
.
2. Mantle Cell Lymphoma:  Received 300mg/m2 of Cytoxan twice a
day for six doses, with high-dose Decadron.  The decadron was
discontinued after the patient developed psychotic paranoia.
She developed tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, and
initially requiring CVVH.  Her counts dropped in response to
chemotherapy and she was neutropenic for several days.  The
patient was treated with neupogen until her counts normalized,
and she remained afebrile.  Her effusions (below) continued to
re-accumulate after taps, and ultimately the decision was made
to treat the patient with the first round of R-CHOP.  She
tolerated the regimen very well, and had no issues completing
the prednisone portion of the therapy.  The patient was
transfused to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above
10.
.
3. Malignant effusion:  The patient originally presented with
shortness of breath from a right pleural effusion and ascites.
Her ascites fluid was drained in the operating room, and not
sent for studies.  Her right pleural effusion was tapped twice,
both large volume.  Cytology was positive for lymphoma.  The
patient had reaccumulation of both fluid collections, which were
unintervenable while she was neutropenic.  Once her counts
recovered, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis of 3
liters, which demonstrated malignant cells.  The patient
remained short of breath after this procedure and underwent a
1.6 liter thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary.  She
tolerated the procedure well with immediate symptomatic
improvement. On a post-procedure x-ray, however, her right lung
remained [**Last Name (un) 57454**]-out. She underwent CTA which demostrated a very
large right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.  The
patient, however, had an improvement in her symptoms and
decrease in her oxygen requirement.  She underwent R-CHOP in an
effort to treat the underlying cause of her effusions.  She was
discharged on 40 po Lasix to take daily, to which she responded
well in the hospital.
.
4. s/p TAH-BSO: The patient was originally thought to have
ovarian cancer, and she underwent TAH-BSO on [**2107-11-1**].  The
diagnosis of lymphoma was made on an intraoperative lymph node
biopsy.  Her ovarian pathology was cystadenofibroma.
.
5. Cardiomyopathy: In the ICU, her ejection fraction was found
to be 20%, which is likely ischemic in origin from "shocked"
myocardium.  Repeat TTE, when her critical illness resolved
revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sided
failure. Prior to beginning treatment with R-CHOP, the patient
again had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of the
right heart failure and 2+ MR.
.
6.  ID:  the patient had asymptomatic pyruia on [**11-14**], and was
treated for 7 days with Zosyn for a Citrobacter UTI.  Repeat
urine culture was negative.  She remained afebrile while
neutropenic.
.
7. Chronic back pain: MRI demonstrated no spinal or vertebral
involvement of her lymphoma.  She was maintained on narcotics
for pain control.  As her ascites reaccumulated, her pain
medication requirement increased.  She was discharged on 10 mg
Oxycontin [**Hospital1 **] and 5 mg Oxycodone q4 prn.  MRI revealed no spinal
involvement of her lymphoma
.
8. Disposition: The patient will go to rehabilitation to assist
her after her prolonged hospitalization and very low functional
status at this point.  Patient had a port placed by surgery on
[**2107-11-17**], which was functional through the hospitalization.  She
was full code.
