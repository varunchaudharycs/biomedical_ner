[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  60% to 65%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  3.4 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity:  *4.2 m/sec  <= 2.0 m/sec
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient:  *81 mm Hg  < 20 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - LVOT diam:  2.0 cm
Aortic Valve - Valve Area:  *0.9 cm2  >= 3.0 cm2
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No mass/thrombus in
the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No
thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Normal RV
chamber size. Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. No masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderate mitral annular calcification. No MS.
Moderate (2+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. The patient received antibiotic
prophylaxis. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-CPB: 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There was minimal
movement of the NCC and RCC. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
7. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
Post-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine, AV-pacing for slow CHB
(initially). Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in aortic position
with trivial valvular AI, transvalvular gradient measured at
15mmHg. Preserved biventricular systolic function, 1+ MR, aortic
contour normal post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 88836**] was a same day admission to the operating room for a
scheduled aortic valve replacement. Please see the operative
report for details,in summary she had:
Aortic valve replacement with a 21mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve. Her
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 57 minutes with a crossclamp
time of 42 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition
with minimal vasopressor support.
She remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op
period, her anesthesia was reversed, she woke neurologically
intact and was extubated.
On POD1 she was transferred from the cardiac surgery ICU too the
stepdown floor for continued post-op care. All tubes lines and
drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. She was
transfused one unit PRBC for post-op anemia. She reports
postoperative intermittent visual changes, lasting only seconds.
No focal defecit appreciated. As discussed with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **],
Ms.[**Known lastname 88836**] will alert the cardiac surgery service if these
symptoms persist. Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] office will also follow up in 1
week after discharge to ascertain whether Ms.[**Known lastname 88836**] will require
an outpatient eval by Neuro and/or Opthamologist.
The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. She worked
with nursing and physical therapy to increase her strength and
endurance. By POD# 5 she was ready for discharge home with
visiting nurses. She is to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1week at
wound clinic and at 1 month in cardiac surgery clinic.
