BIOPSY of cystic lesion drainage: pending

[**12-23**] HEAD CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Left cerebellar hypodense lesion, with mild interval increase
in size
since the prior study. An MRI is recommended for further
evaluation.
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

[**12-24**] BRAIN MRI IMPRESSION:
1. Enlargement in the size of the left posterior fossa cystic
lesion despite drain in situ. Signal characteristics today are
suggestive of subacute blood products.
2. Increase in the surrounding vasogenic edema and increased
mass effect on the fourth ventricle and inferior displacement of
cerebellar tonsils without new hydrocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67 yo female with h/o stage IV ovarian ca s/p surgery,
6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, cyst aspiration of a cerebellar lesion
and Cyberknife treatments now admitted with increased HAs, n/v,
dysarthria likely [**2-6**] increased edema in brain lesion.
.
# N/V/dysarthria: Pt was initially admitted to the neurosurgical
service in the ICU for close observation. A head CT was
performed which revealed cerebellar cyst versus edema. She was
given 10mg decadron, IV hydration, Decadron 4mg Q6h. She
underwent an MRI w and w/o contrast which showed enlargement in
the size of the left posterior fossa cystic lesion and increase
in the surrounding vasogenic edema and increased mass effect on
the fourth ventricle.  Overnight, she neurologically improved.
Her dysarthria, H/A & N/V resolved. Pt was transferred to OMED
floor, where she continued to be largely aymptomatic.  Neurosurg
attempted to drain from the cystic lesion, however, was
unsuccessful.  The drainage was then planned by IR the next day
and approx 14cc of fluid was drained.  The fluid was sent to the
lab for analysis.  likely [**2-6**] increased edema seen on imaging.
Pt was continued on Reglan PRN, Compazine PRN and Zofran PRN for
nausea.  At discharge, Dexamethasone was started to be tapered.
Pt was also initiated on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
# Hyponatremia: Her Na was initially 125.  Likely SIADH [**2-6**]
brain edema. Improved with fluid restriction and salt tabs. Na
133 on day of discharge.
.
# Stage IV ovarian cancer:  Pt was continued on pain control
with home Motrin, Oxycodone PRN.  Pt has f/u MRI and appt on
[**2120-1-28**] with Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic.  Given pt's unusual metastatic
spread of her ovarian cancer to the brain and history of
prostate cancer in the family at a young age, it can be
considered to do genetic testing (incl BRCA) as outpt.
.
# Depression/Insomnia:  Pt was continued on home Citalopram and
Ativan qhs PRN.
.
# HTN/HL:  Pt was continued on home HCTZ, Lisinopril, Verapamil.
 It can be considered as outpt to discontinue HCTZ, given pt's
persistent hyponatremia.  Pt was continued on home Simvastatin.

.
# Pt was on a regular diet, oncology repletion scales. Pain
control was with Motrin, Oxycodone PRN.  Pt was on a bowel
regimen and a PPI.  Pt was on DVT PPx with SC Heparin.  Pt was
full code.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during this admission. You
were admitted for headaches, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty
speaking. You had an MRI of your head that showed increased size
of cystic lesion. Neurosurgery tried to drain the fluid but were
unable to. You had a second procedure with interventional
radiology, who was able to remove some fluid. Your headaches
improved.

The following medications were changed during this admission:

START [**Known lastname **] chloride 1mg, 2 tablets, three times daily (this is
to maintain your [**Known lastname **] levels at a normal level)

START Oxycodone 5mg 1-2 tablets every four hours as needed for
pain
**This medication can cause sedation, do not take this
medication while if you feel sedated or confused. And you should
not be driving while on this medication, or at all.

START Bactrim DS (Oral) 800-160 mg Tablet, 1 tablet on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday (this is an antibiotic that prevents an
infection called PCP in the lungs; this is important to take
since you are on steroids and may be more susceptible to
infection)

The dose of Dexamethasone was changed; Please follow the
schedule below:
START Dexamethasone 6mg by mouth twice daily for 3 days, then
take 4mg twice daily for 3 days, then take 6mg daily in the
morning. You should see your doctor in the interim to determine
how long you need to be on the dexamethasone.

Continue all other medications you were on prior to this
admission.
**You have been continued on your home dose of
hydrochlorathiazide 25mg daily. However, we would like you to
discuss discontinuing this with your doctor. [**First Name (Titles) 2172**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] has
been low during this admission, which has been controlled with
restriction of 1L of fluid and salt tabs. However, HCTZ can also
lower the [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Since you have been stable on this medication,
you were continued on it. Though, please discuss this with your
doctor at follow-up.

**In terms of travel, it is safe for you to visit you family.
However, you should NOT drive. This can be very dangerous,
especially since you recently had a procedure.

??????	Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,
or excessive bending.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)
while taking narcotic pain medication.
