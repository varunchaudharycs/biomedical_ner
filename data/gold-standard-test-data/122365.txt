Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 65 year-old male with history of recent
hospitalization for bilateral pulmonary emboli, DVTs, and
spontaneous intra-hepatic hematoma requiring massive transfusion
protocal activation sent today from PCP's office after four days
of right lower extremity pain.  Patient found to have ultrasound
evidence of a full length right lower extremtiy DVT.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] was admitted from [**2185-4-23**] - [**2185-5-1**] for left sided
chest pain and was found to have bilateral PEs.  Patient was
initially anticoagulated with heparin, which was transitioned to
lovenox and warfarin.  Patient developed abdominal pain and was
found on CT scan to have an intrahepatic hematoma with
extravasation.  He was taken to IR, but no active extravasation
was discovered and nothing was embolized.  He received 4 units
PRBC with massive transfusion protocol and 1 unit platelets.  He
received additional 2 units of PRBC on day 1 of MICU stay
because of hypotension, which was attributed to hemorrhage.
Transplant surgery was consulted and recommended conservative
management of intrahepatic hematoma.  MICU course was
complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
 As anticoagulation was contra-indicated given bleed, IR placed
IVC filter on [**2185-4-25**].  Patient was discharged on no
anticoagulation.
.
Today patient presented to his primary care doctor's office
complaining of 4 days of right lower extremity pain with
numbness in his leg and loss of sensation in his right foot.
The pain is exacerbated by direct pressure on his foot. He notes
pain extending from his mid calf until the top of his thigh.
.
Patient was sent to the emergency department. Initial vitals
were T 97.9, HR 116, BP 124/85, R 20, O2 Sat 98% on 4L.  He
triggered on arrival for a pulseless right foot. Initially the
emergency department was concerned for arterial compromise. An
ultrasound of the RLE showed evidence of a full RLE DVT.
Vascular surgery was consulted and felt that the limb was
non-threatened as patient had palpable right femoral, popliteal,
and DP pulses and recommended anticoagulation when safe,
elevation of RLE, and ACE wrap.
.
In ED patient also complained intermittent, vague abdominal
pain. He had a CT Abdomen/Pelvis showing a stable liver
hematoma.  The CT also showed the IVC filter with clot extending
2.2 cm above the filter in the IVC.  Patient was evaluated by
transplant surgery who felt there was no role for surgical
intervenstion adn the risk/benefit of anticoagulation in the
setting of liver hematoma should be made by primary team.
Patient received no medications or blood. He received 1.5 L of
IVF.  On transfer vitals were T 100.1, HR 124, BP 138/98, RR 27,
O2 sat 98RA.
.
On the floor, patient reports that he has leg pain from his
right mid-posterior calf extending up though thigh to his right
groin.  He has some mild numbness and tingling on the back of
his right calf.  He denies abdominal pain unless someone presses
down on his abdomen.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea,
lightheadedness, syncope.  His abdominal pain is improved from
his last admission.  Patient has noted recent weight loss and
decreased appetite recently. Endorses fatigue and weakness.

RLE Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Vein thrombosis seen throughout the entire extent of
the right
lower extremity. Dampened waveforms in contralateral left common
femoral vein are suggestive of more proximal thrombosis.

CTA Aorta, Bifem, Iliac:
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent three-vessel runoff.
2. Findings in the abdomen and pelvis, including subcapsular
liver hematoma and IVC thrombus extending into the right common
iliac, external iliac, and likely common femoral veins as well
as possibly into the left common iliac vein, better assessed on
CT abdomen/pelvis performed just prior to this, on [**2185-5-11**] at
21:50, see that report.
3. Apparent diffuse wall thickening of the urinary bladder may
relate to its underdistension, however, recommend correlation
with urinalysis to exclude underlying infection.
4. Enlarged prostate gland; recommend correlation with serum PSA
if this has not already been performed.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. 17 x 19 x 6 cm subcapsular liver hematoma, which appears
stable compared to the [**Month (only) 547**] examination. Active extravasation
does not appear present, but is limited on this single-phase
study.
2. IVC filter with a clot extending cephalad 2.2 cm above the
top of the
filter. However, thrombus does not extend into the renal veins.
Occlusive
thrombus into the right common iliac internal and external
iliacs and common femoral vein. There may be partially occlusive
thrombus in the left common iliac.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 65 year-old man with h/o recent hospitalization
and MICU stay for bilateral pulmonary embolism complicated by
spontaneous intra-hepatic hemorrhage presenting on this
admission with RLE pain and numbness found to have full length
RLE DVT.
.
# Right Lower Extremity DVT:  Patient with history of recent b/l
PE, complicated by intra-hepatic hematoma on anticoagulation.
Patient discharged home on recent prior admission with IVC
filter, not on anticoagulation.  On this admission, patient
found to have a large RLE DVT.  Patient with palpable peripheral
pulses bilaterally.  Evaluated by vascular surgery in ED, who
felt that his RLE was non-threatened and no surgical
intervention was required.  Given the risk of extension of DVT
to the point where vascular compromise could be reached, as well
as the risk of further extending PEs, we cautiously
anticoagulated the patient with careful monitoring for fear that
the pt would patient have another hepatic bleed. Patient was
admitted to ICU and anticoagulation was started with heparin gtt
with goal of 60 - 80.  Patient reached the therapeutic level and
his HCT remained stable.  Serial vascular exams were stable.
The RLE was elevated and wrapped in ACE.  He was then sent to
the regular medicine floor.  However, unfortunately he then had
his platelets drop, and was found to have heparin induced
thrombocytopenia (see below), and was transitioned to argatroban
for his DVT.  He was then transitioned to coumadin prior to D/C.
 His INR was 4.0 on day of discharge, and he was instructed to
follow up with his PCP for further monitoring of his INR with a
goal of between [**2-3**].
.
# Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelets dropped
from 247 on [**5-11**] to 118 on [**2185-5-14**], which normally would not fit
with the traditional window for HIT, but pt had received heparin
on his prior admission also.  Hematology was consulted, and
recommended switching to argatroban, which we did.  Patient's
PF4 test was sent, and returned with an optical density of 2.7,
so the lab cancelled our serotonin release assay as the PF4 was
considered positive enough.  Patient was instructed to get a
heparin allergy bracelet with help from his PCP.
.
#  Recent subcapsular hepatic bleed: Patient with recent ICU
stay requiring massive transfusion protocol following
spontaneous subcapsular hepatic bleed while on anticoagulation.
Patient discharged home from prior admission on no
anti-coagulation.  For this admission, imaging showed that his
liver hematoma had a stable appearance.  Surgery was consulted
in the ED and recommended no surgical intervention at this time.
 Surgery recommended supportive care should the bleed recur, but
patient remained with stable VSs and no RUQ abdominal pain.
.
# Bilateral pulmonary embolism: Patient initially presented with
left sided chest and flank pain when admitted in [**2185-4-1**].
The etiology of emboli is unclear - patient was discharged with
plan for outpatient hypercoagulable work-up.  Patient discharged
with IVC filter, not on anti-coagulation.  Concern for extension
of pulmonary embolism on this admission as clot extended
proximally above IVC filter.  Patient remained mildly
tachycardiac throughout the admission, but not hypoxic, dyspnic,
and did not have chest pain.  Patient's PE's were treated with
argatroban when his DVT was treated with argatroban.  HIT may
have contributed to extension of clots above IVC filter.
Patient will need outpatient anticoagulation w/u, but this is
complicated by the fact that he is now on coumadin for at least
6 months.
.
# h/o [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease: Previously followed by Endocrine at [**Hospital1 18**].
Per patient not receiving any treatment. Denies symptoms or
hyper/hypothyroid at this time.  TSH was wnl therefore no
intervention undertaken.
.
# Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension, and was
hypertensive on admission. Patient had not been taking
lisinopril since discharge.  Lisinopril was held in the ICU
while anticoagulating given bleeding risk, and patient remained
normotensive there as well as when transferred to the floor.
Therefore, we did not restart pt's lisinopril at dispo and
instructed him to f/u with his PCP.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Simvastatin 10mg qhs held after last admission
as patient had transaminitis likely [**2-2**] subcapsular liver bleed.
 LFTs were wnl.  Therefore we restarted simvastatin on this
admission.
.
# Code: Full (discussed with patient)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**],
You were seen in the hospital for a blood clot in your leg.
While you were here, it was determined that you have an allergy
to heparin.  You should never be given heparin in the future.
Please arrange with your PCP to have an allergy bracelet made so
that you aren't given heparin.  You were put on an oral blood
thinner called coumadin, that you will have to continue to take
once a day until your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to stop taking it.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1) We STARTED you on COUMADIN (WARFARIN).  You will take 7.5mg
on [**5-25**], then take 10mg once per day starting on [**5-26**] until Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you to change to a different dose.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
follow your coumadin levels and adjust your dose of coumadin as
needed.  If you have any questions, you should call him.
2) We STOPPED your LISINOPRIL because your blood pressure is
already well controlled on no anti-hypertensive medications.
Your PCP may tell you to restart this medication at some point.

If you experience any of the below listed Danger Signs, or any
other new symptom, please call your doctor or go to the nearest
Emergency Room.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
