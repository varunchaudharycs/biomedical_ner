Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Wellbutrin / Kaopectate

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
Non-responsiveness and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T tube placement and cholangiogram
EGD x 4


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 year old female with history of dementia,
hypertension, type two diabetes mellitus, bipolar disease who
presents with two weeks of declining social functioning and PO
intake, usually able to walk with walker and perform ADL. CT
scan at [**Hospital1 2025**] showed (-)CT and (-) troponins. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**10-12**], tox screen (-), CEs (-), primary team managing BP meds
and psyche meds. Was being worked up on [**Wardname 836**] for renal failure
and balancing HTN meds, when found by NSG staff to be
'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds.
Code blue called, initial blood pressure 80/50 with improvement
in mentation to baseline. Two hours after event, noted to have
decreasing BPs to 60s with concurrent mental status changes.
Repeat BPs in trendelenburg resolved to 110 with return of
mentation. She was transferred to the MICU on [**2186-10-15**] for NSG
concern of hypotension.
.
In the MICU she had three more episodes. These were
characterized by unresponsiveness, lack of a radial pulse (no
femoral pulse was taken), and a post-ictal confusional state
most consistent with seizures. Her EKG during these episodes was
unremarkable, although she does have a baseline RBBB. Hence,
heart block was deemed unlikely. MICU team was suspicious of
seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal and
tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after
episode. Further, given her diabetes and her labile blood
pressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern. She was
worked up by multiple teams, including Neurology. Per neurology
a head CT was obtained which indicated atrophy w/ mild
microangiopathic changes. She was put on EEG monitoring to
capture seizure activity however she did not have an episode
during monitoring. Other considerations were her baseline
psyciatric disorder or medication regimen. She was seen by
Psychiatry who do not feel her episodes of hypotension are
entirely explained by her bipolar disorder. Finally nephrology
was consulted to evaluate a renal source of her labile BP and
possible source of hypotensive episodes. Nephrology determined
she did not have RAS by US and Captopril study and did not feel
that her labile BP was renal in origin. Ultimately, it was felt
that a polypharmacy of her BP and anti-psychotic medications
were responsible for these episodes. Her BP/ Psych med regimen
were tapered and she has been stable for 3 days. She was
transferred to [**Wardname **] [**2186-10-17**] for further workup of an anion gap
and elevated WBC prior to anticipated discharge to a rehab
facility.
.
Of note, recently hospitalized @QuincyMC for mania, had episode
of syncope; workup head CT, head MRI, neck MRA, carotid doppler
studies, EEG, CXR, and echocardiogram. Head MRI notable for
periventricular white matter changes suggesting small vessel
disease. TTE showed normal sized LV with hyperdynamic systolic
function and EF of 75%. EEG normal. MRA of neck showed 65-70%
stenosis of internal carotids bilaterally.

Radiographic Studies:
Chest AP (prelim) - Allowing for difference in technique,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild
cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
lungs are clear.
.
([**2186-10-13**]) ECG:  NSR, RBBB, LAFB, LVH. unchanged from prior
.
([**2186-10-16**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations for symptoms. Routine sampling and automated
detection programs recorded no epileptiform features or
electrographic seizures. There was some multifocal slowing
admixed to the waking background, but this would be assessed
better through routine EEG tracings. There were no areas of
fixed focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
.
([**2186-10-14**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in
the waking and drowsy states due to intermittent brief bursts of
mixed frequency slowing seen in the temporal regions
bilaterally, independently and asynchronously. The findings
suggest underlying subcortical dysfunction in those regions. In
a patient of this age, vascular disease would be among the
common causes. In addition, there were brief bursts of
generalized mixed frequency slowing, more non-specific in
etiology. There were no clearly epileptiform features. No
electrographic seizures were noted.
.
([**2186-10-13**])CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  Moderate degree of atrophy with
mild microangiopathic changes.
.
([**2186-10-13**]) RENAL US IMPRESSION:  Study limited by patient
factors: blood flow to both kidneys, there is no hydronephrosis,
nephrolithiasis, simple cysts in both kidneys
.
([**2186-10-16**]) RENAL CAPTOPRIL SCAN IMPRESSION: Essentially normal
captopril renal scan. Specifically, no evidence
of renal artery stenosis.
.
([**10-17**] and [**2186-10-17**]) EEG:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations
for
symptoms. Routine sampling and automated detection programs
recorded no
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. There was some
multifocal slowing admixed to the waking background, but this
would be
assessed better through routine EEG tracings. There were no
areas of
fixed focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
.
([**2186-10-20**]): Chest X-ray
IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe opacity.
.
([**2186-10-20**]): Transthoracic Echo:
 The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional systolic function.
.
([**2186-10-22**]): EKG:
Artifact is present. Probable sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation.
Left
anterior fascicular block. There is an early transition which is
non-specific
with subsequent loss of anterolateral R waves associated with
anterior
and anterolateral ST-T wave changes consistent with probable
myocardial
infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T
wave
changes. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Compared to the
prior
tracing right bundle-branch block is now incomplete.
.
([**2186-10-26**]): Liver Ultrasound
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings are suspicious for acute cholecystitis and possible
focal necrosis and perforation of the gallbladder wall.

2. Right renal cysts.
.
([**2186-10-26**]): CT Pelvis/Abdomen/Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. Small amount of free fluid in deep pelvis posterior to the
rectum and anterior to the sacrum, without fluid collection or
free air. Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Atelectasis and patchy opacities in the lungs, without discrete
consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.
2. Renal cysts.
3. Nonspecific fluid-filled distended second portion of duodenum
surrounded by mild fat stranding, with slight fat stranding
surrounding the pancreatic head. The finding is nonspecific;
however, in this patient with elevated white blood cell,
duodenitis or early pancreatitis cannot be excluded. Please
correlate with laboratory values.
4. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid with questionable
sludge. If indicated, please consider gallbladder ultrasound.
.
([**2186-10-28**]): CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Percutaneous gallbladder drain contained within the
gallbladder. The gallbladder is decompressed. No perihepatic or
intra-abdominal fluid or hemorrhage is identified. Stable
stranding surrounding the second and third portions of the
duodenum and pancreatic head
.
([**2186-10-30**]): Ultrasound of lower extremities:
IMPRESSION: No evidence for deep venous thrombus in bilateral
lower extremities.
.
([**2186-10-30**]): Head CT w/out contrast:
IMPRESSION: Aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinus and
increased opacity in the right frontoethmoid recess. Please
correlate clinically. Otherwise, no significant change,
including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or large recent
infarction.
.
([**2186-11-3**]): Gallbladder scan:
IMPRESSION: 1. Prompt filling of the gallbladder and exit into
the duodenum.
2. Patent cholecystostomy drainage tube. 3. No evidence of leak
outside of the
gallbladder.
.
([**2186-11-5**]): Ultrasound of abdomen:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of main portal vein thrombosis. The more distal
branches of the portal vein were not interrogated. If there is
further clinical concern, additional dedicated views of the
portal vein vasculature can be performed.

2. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder, likley due to collapsed
state.
3. Stable simple-appearing right renal cysts.
.
([**2186-11-27**]) Ultrasound of thyroid:
IMPRESSION:

1. Completely absent right lobe of the thyroid. Small remnant of
the left thyroid lobe is unchanged compared to the prior study.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 84 year old female with mild dementia,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus type two, and bipolar disease,
who presented on [**2186-10-11**] from [**Hospital3 **] with failure to
thrive, and was being worked up for renal failure and balancing
hypertension medications, who was found by nursing staff to be
'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds
and transferred to intensive care unit.
.
# Unresponsive episodes -
Patient had initial episode of unresponsiveness, and additional
episodes witnessed by the intensive care team. There was concern
for seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal
and tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after
episode. Given her diabetes and her labile blood pressure,
autonomic seizures were of particular concern, as was complete
heart block (given known RBBB with LAFB) however telemetry
tracings remained within normal limits. It was also concerning
that her medications could be playing role. She was monitored on
telemetry which was unrevealing for a cause, a transthoracic
echo did not reveal clear cause, nor did continuous EEG
monitoring. Several of her blood pressure medications were held
to avoid hypotensive episodes, which ultimately felt to be the a
large part of the cause.
She had no further episodes after her first transfer out of the
intensive care unit on [**2186-10-17**].
.
# Hypertension - Patient has historically difficult to control
blood pressure, with typical systolic blood pressure of 180's as
an outpatient. An abdominal bruit was appreciated on exam. A
renal ultarsound showed bilateral flow with doplers. Imaging
with captopril was obtained to further evaluate for renal artery
stenosis, and was within normal limits. A work up for other
secondary causes was initiated, including hyperaldosterone,
hyper-renin, hyper-ACTH, and pheochromocytoma. Her work up
revealed slightly elevated normetanephrine in serum and urine,
as well as very mildly elevated epinephrine, norepinephrine,
dopamine, and catecholamines; it was not felt that these were
consistent with a pheochromocytoma. An AM cortisol was found to
be elevated and resistant to supression by 1mg dexamethasone
overnight. Because of that, a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained on
[**2186-10-26**] to look for source of Cushings syndrome or ectopic
ACTH secretion-- it showed inflammation around the duodenum and
head of the pancreas but no adrenal masses.
.
Her blood pressure medications were slowly re-introduced, to
avoid hypotension, with goal systolic blood pressure greater
than 130's to 140's.
.
At time of discharge, her blood pressure medications were:
- Metoprolol 100 mg q8 hours
- Clonidine TTS 2 patch weekly
- Captopril 75 mg q8 hours
.
# Arrythmias: Cardiology was consulted early in her stay after
episodes of V-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and PVCs. It was recommended to
continue rate control metoprolol, as well as continue her ACE-I.
Electrophysiology was asked to see patient again on [**2186-10-22**]
for repeated episodes of V-[**Year (4 digits) **]. At that time, amiodarone was
initiated at 200 TID,
tapered to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-1**], and finally continued at 200 mg
daily since [**2186-11-14**].  She had no further arrythmias noted.
.
# Renal insufficiency - Upon admission, she had worsening of her
renal function with a creatinine to 1.7. It was felt that her
renal insufficiency was pre-renal in nature, and she was given
gentle intravenous fluids. It was thought she had an element of
diabetic nephropathy as well. The renal team was consulted and
assisted with management of her care. Her creatinine rose to 2.0
at its peak, coinciding with her hypotensive episodes. At time
of discharge,  her renal function was stable at 0.8-1.2, and she
continued to put out good amounts of urine..
.
# Type two diabetes mellitus - Patient was on glipizide at home,
however with her worsening renal function and very little PO
intake, a sliding scale of insulin was started, and basal
insulin was added as needed.
At time of discharge, she was on 30 units of lantus in addition
to a humalong sliding scale.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Patient has history of thyroid carcinoma and
is status-post thyroidectomy. At time of admission, her TSH was
very suppressed, but her free T4 level was within normal limits.
Her TSH rose during her stay, peaking at 32. Her T4 studies were
found to be low. Endocrine consultation was obtained to assist
with management of her thyroid disease, especially with
concurrent use of amiodarone and lithium. Her dose of
levothyroxine was increased to 300 mcg for several days, then
brought down to 175 mcg prior to discharge.  Her TSH remained
elevated (15) on a subsequent check on [**12-13**].  This was associated
with a normal free T4 (1.5).  After discussion with
endocrinology, it was felt that she may not be absorbing well
and may be becoming progressively more hypothyroid.  Her tube
feeds should be held 30 minutes before and after administering
synthroid; she should have her levels followed to ensure that
this is effective.  If she is still underreplaced, she may need
to have IV levothyroxine.
- Her thyroid function tests should be checked and followed up
1-2 weeks after discharge.
- An ultrasound of her thyroid was checked to assess for any
thyroid disease or cancer recurrence in light of her elevated
TSH. The ultrasound was unchanged from prior studies.
.
# Upper gastrointestinal bleed: On [**2186-11-4**] patient developed
a decline in her hematocrit to 19, with guaiac positive stools,
then melena and bright red blood per rectum. She was transferred
to the intensive care unit, and gastroenterology was consulted.
An upper endoscopy revealed bleeding duodenal ulcers that were
injected and cauterized. She required a total of 9 units of
packed red blood cells during her intensive care stay.
Her hematocrit remained relatively stable after her transfer
back to the general floors on [**2186-11-8**], until [**2186-11-15**], at
which time her hematocrit continued to drift downward and her
stools were guaiac positive. Plans were made for a colonoscopy,
however, in light of an additional hematocrit drop to 20, a
repeat endoscopy was completed on [**2186-11-17**], and a new third
duodenal ulcer was noted which was also treated. She received
two additional units of red blood cells.
.
Testing for h. pylori was negative, and gastrin levels were
elevated; the elevated gastrin levels were expected in setting
of PPI use, and endocrine consultation did not feel there was
any additional pathology contributing to the elevated gastrin
levels.
- [**Hospital1 **] PPI was initiated and should be continued for at least 4
additional weeks, then continued daily.
- Patient will need follow up with gastroenterology after
discharge, for possible further evaluation of nodules seen
during her first endoscopy.
.
# C. Difficile Colitis: Patient developed diarrhea on
[**2186-11-24**], and stool samples revealed c. difficile. She was
initiated on treatment with flagyl on [**2186-11-25**], however was
refusing oral medications, so intravenous flagyl was
administered until [**2186-12-2**] at which time she could receive
oral medications via her PEG.
She did not have any abdominal pain or distention.
Her white blood cell count bumped to >20 at the time of her c.
difficile infection.  Then improved.  Around [**12-5**] her WBC count
again increased, with no other clear etiology found.  It was
decided to change flagyl back to IV, and to add PO vanco.  The
plan is to continue IV flagyl and PO vanco until about a week
after WBC stopping other antibiotics (cipro for UTI).
.
# Bipolar Disorder:
Patient had recent hospitalization for manic episode at outside
hospital. She has long standing history of depression and manic
episodes, with numerous prior psychiatric admissions. Her family
gave history that many of her prior depressive episodes had
started with refusal to eat.
.
Psychiatry team was consulted at the start of her stay and
followed along the entire time. Therapeutic options for her
bipolar disease were limited given her multiple serious medical
co-morbidities. There was concern during her stay for seizures
and serotonin syndrome, however neither was felt to have taken
place. She was titrated upward on citalopram to 40 mg (increased
from 20 mg on [**2186-11-24**] and increased from 30mg on [**2186-12-11**]).
Given her prior success on lithium, which had been stopped due
to "toxicity" of unclear etiology, the decision was made to
re-introduce lithium while in the inpatient setting where the
patient could be carefully monitored. 150 mg qHS was started on
[**2186-11-8**], and levels were closely followed, with goal level
about 0.5.
.
ECT: Psychiatry felt that one of the best options would be ECT,
however the patient continued to adamantly voice her refusal.
Several family meetings took place with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], primary medical, and psychiatric teams to
discuss various options for her severe depression, which was
felt to be the main reason for her failure to thrive and poor PO
intake.
Given her refusal to ECT, legal guardianship would need to be
pursued if the patient's family desired to pursue ECT and it was
necessary to deem the patient incompetent to make a decision
regarding ECT due to her depression.
- Remeron was considered, but contraindicated with use of
clonidine.
- Rilatin was also considered, but contraindicated with her
cardiac arrhythmias.
- Patient will need continued follow up with psychiatry as an
outpatient.
.
At time of discharge, the patient's mood and affect had improved
greatly since her initial presentation, and she appeared much
less flat. She was answering questions with complete sentences
with improved, though still limited, range of emotions.
.
# Failure to thrive/Anorexia - Patient continued to refuse to
eat and take her medications during most of her stay. As her
medical problems cleared, she became more interactive and
started to eat small amounts and take her medications. After
much discussion and a trial of one week once medically stable to
improve PO intake, decision was made to place PEG tube, which
was completed on [**2186-12-1**].
- Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted and
followed along during the patient's stay.
- Thyroid management as detailed above.
.
# Dementia: Patient has history of mild dementia. She was
initially on Namenda, however it was held due to her
unresponsive episodes, contribution to hypertension, and
possible serotonin syndrome.
.
# Tachypnea: Patient had intermittent episodes of increased
respiratory rate, ranging 25 - 30. Her oxygenation remained
normal, and her lungs were clear, and she denied any complaints.
Several chest x-rays were unrevealing. Her tachypnea improved
overall, but she would occasionally have episodes of increased
respiratory rate when aroused, agitated (eg by asking several
questions).
.
# Acalculus Cholecystitis:
A RUQ US showed possible GB wall necrosis and microperforation.
Surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous GB tube,
which was placed on [**2186-10-27**].  It was assumed that this was
the source of her persistent leukocytosis, since her WBC fell to
15 after placement of the tube, but the WBC has since increased.
 On [**10-28**] after the procedure, levo/flagyl was switched to zosyn
for better gram negative coverage.  Vanco was continued.
Throughout all this, she has had no fevers, denies abdominal
pain and has a relatively benign abd exam w/ no guarding,
rebound or RUQ tenderness.  Surgery strongly feels that she does
not have an "acute abdmonial process" and they want to revisit
the idea of an elective cholecystectomy in [**3-18**] weeks.  However,
it seems most likely that the necrotic GB was the course of the
persistent leukocytosis.
- Her drain site remained clean, dry, and intact.
- Several cultures from her bile drain were without growth
except for one that haad coagulase negative staph, felt to be a
contaminant.
- Patient's percutaneous gall bladder drain was clamped on [**12-8**]
and removed on [**2186-12-11**].
.
# Conjunctivitis: Patient completed course of treatment with
erythromycin eye drops.
.
# Oral Thrush: Patient occasionally had evidence of white
exudate on her tongue, which was possibly thrush given her very
poor PO intake and refusal of mouth care ans swabs. It was
possible that thrush was also contributing to her lack of
appetite.
- Nystatin S+S was initiated.  It can be given on a prn basis
for recurrence.
.
# Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Patient's cardiac enzymes bumped
slightly in setting of her gastrointestinal bleed and relative
hypotension. She had no chest pain or EKG changes, and it was
felt that she had an episode of demand ischemia.
.
# Tranaminitis: Patient's transaminases were elevated into the
[**2178**], which occurred following her gastrointestinal bleed and
episode of relative hypotension when her systolic blood pressure
was into the 100s in setting of bleed. It was suspected that she
suffered from ischemic process (CEs also bumped) due to
hypotension. She had also  been getting tylenol during her
during intensive care stay, but not greater than 2 grams per
day.
- A RUQ US was obtained to rule out thrombosis or other process
was completed without any apparent new pathology.
.
# Thrombocytopenia- Patient developed thrombocytopenia down to
127 at the lowest. This resolved during her stay, and it was
thought to be due to her poor nutritional status.
- There were no clear offending medications on her medication
