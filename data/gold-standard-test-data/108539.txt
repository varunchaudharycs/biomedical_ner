Ablation
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with a PMH of a-fib, OSA, PVD secondary to a
gunshot wound to his right lower leg, and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with a reported EF of 15-20% in the past and a
recent EF of 40%. He had an AICD placed in [**5-30**], and he has had
4 episodes of syncope in the past 2 months. He has been shocked
8x in total, with one episode shocking him four times
consecutively.  His history of cardiomyopathy (best attributed
to a possible viral illness, per patient report), dates back 8
years.  He has also had long standing a-fib, and it is unclear
whether he had the cardiomyopathy or a-fib first as he has never
been symptomatic until [**Month (only) 205**].
.
He has had 3 hospitalizations for syncope since [**2122-5-21**]. The
first of which was [**5-24**] weekend, when his wife reports
witnessing him lose consciousness for a few seconds and falling
out of a chair.  He was evaluated at [**Hospital 107**] Hospital, was
found to have VT, and had an AICD placed on [**2122-5-26**].
.
0n [**7-9**] he woke up from sleep, his AICD fired and 15 minutes
later it fired again. He was asymptomatic at the time, he was
then taken to [**Hospital3 8544**] and transferred to [**Hospital 107**]
hospital.  He was given a loading dose of amiodarone, and
converted to lower dose because of dizziness.  He was discharged
home and on [**7-17**], he was feeding his horses and felt dizzy and
lightheaded, fell to the ground had a jerking motion, his family
again witnessed the event.  He didn't feel like he was shocked,
and had no palpitations at the time. He lost consciousness and
his wife was able to get him into the car and take him to the
hospital.  He was initially treated for what was thought to be
ischemic chest pain. At [**Hospital3 **] they gave him dilaudid
for chest discomfort which caused him to flush and have
diaphoresis.  He was transferred to [**Location (un) 796**] and they gave him
nitroglycerin, which caused his blood pressure to drop. This
entire course he was kept on  amiodarone of 400mg [**Hospital1 **]. He had
several 6-7 beat runs of NSVT while there and on Monday [**7-20**] he
was intially increased to 400mg TID of amio, then due to
persistent episodes of NSVT he was put on IV amio at 1mg/min and
transitioned today to 0.5mg/min.
.
His outpatient cardiologist was concerned for AICD lead
migration and on [**7-21**] he was taken to the cath lab for lead
replacement. Subsequently he developed 20 beats of VT, at which
time the aforementioned amio drip was started at 1mg/minute.
Since that time his EKG and tele has shown paced beats and
ectopy.
.
Of note at the OSH his creatinine was 1.1, CE negative x 3,
electrolytes WNL, Vanc ppx for lead placement, Coreg was
decreased to 25 [**Hospital1 **], Coumadin was held, mag oxide added to keep
a-fib better controlled. He was continued on digoxin and
lisinopril. BPs ranged 86-126/46-60.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for syncope, orthopnea
(chronic), and lower extremity edema right greater than left, as
well as absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations.
.
On the floor, initial vitals were T: 96.5, BP: 98/72, HR: 93,
RR: 23, SaO2 95% on RA, resting comfortably in bed, asymptomatic
with his wife and son at the bedside.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function appears severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) but is
difficult to assess due to poor image quality and frequent
ventricular ectopy. Relative preservation of basal inferolateral
wall function. There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of
the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular
rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated left ventricle
with severe systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular dilation and
dysfunction.
.
Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2122-7-28**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no
angiongraphically apparent disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA
had no
evidence of angiographically apparent disease.
2.  Resting hemodyanamics revealed slightly elevated right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 15mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at
7
l/min.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Normal ventricular function.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2122-7-29**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-7-22**],
biventricular systolic cavity sizes are smaller and systolic
function is slightly improved.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old with a PMH significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, chronic a-fib, and ventricullar tachycardia s/p
AICD placement on [**2122-5-26**], that was transferred from [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital in RI for treatment of ventricular tachycardia with
ablation.
.
# Ventricular tachycardia/dialated cardiomyopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has
ventricular tachycardia in the setting of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  These episodes of ventricular tachycardia
started in [**2122-5-21**], he is s/p AICD placement and has had
several instances recently of firing of his AICD.  Etiology of
his v-tach is likely cardiomyopathy resulting in ectopy.  An
initial echo was done the morning after admission and showed
dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, also
right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic.  He was conitnued on an amiodarone drip
of 0.5mg/min until he was taken for EP procedure on [**2122-7-23**].
During the study, they were beginning to warm a site for
ablation, and he went into fast VT, so the study was aborted.
He converted back to his normal rhythm.  His amiodarone was
converted to 200mg PO TID and he still had VT with walking
minimal distances, therefore loading dose was increased to 400mg
[**Hospital1 **], with plan to transition to 200mg PO BID in one week
(starting [**2122-8-1**]).  Now currently undergoing workup for heart
transplant.  CT chest completed which showed multifocal small
ground-glass nodules predominantly involving the upper lobes,
requiring a follow up repeat CT in [**2-24**] weeks as an outpatient.
CT abd/pelvis showed hypoattenuating left upper pole renal
lesion, most likely benign, but a renal US could be considered
as an outpatient.  Hepatitis A,B,C, CMV and HIV serologies were
negative.

While on the floor [**2122-7-27**] and [**2122-7-28**] he had increased runs of
VTach resulting in AICD firing.  The device fired once on [**2122-7-27**]
at 9:30 in the morning when he was walking with the EP team to
reproduce symptoms.  On the 7th, he was washing his hair sitting
at the sink and he became symptomatic with lightheadedness and
flushing.  He had 2 runs of VTach that both resulted in ICD
firings at 8:09 and 8:10 in the morning.  He was taken to cath
immediately following, and then he was taken to the EP lab for
readjustment of his leads.  The lead wires were adjusted to
remove slack from the wires.  He tolerated the procedure well
and has been without any runs of VTach since.

He received a TTE on [**2122-7-29**] when compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2122-7-22**], biventricular systolic cavity
sizes are smaller and systolic function is slightly improved to
30-35%. A right/left heart cardiac catheterization that showed:
right dominant system that demonstrated no angiongraphically
apparent disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA had no evidence of
angiographically apparent disease. Resting hemodyanamics
revealed slightly elevated right sided filling pressures with
RVEDP of 15mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at 7 l/min. His
volume status was medically managed and he was transitioned back
to his home PO Lasix of 20mg daily.
.
# Contact dermatitis/cellulitis: He developed a likely contact
dermatitis after lead replacement at OSH.  The contact
dermatitis may have been from the chlorhexadine prep during the
procedure as the patient reported that this happened in the past
during a prior cath.  The contact dermatitis likely became
super-infected and he developed erispelas which was treated
successfully with doxycyline for 7 days last dose [**2122-7-28**].
.
# Atrial fibrillation: His atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled and medically managed.  His coumadin was held
secondary to need for cardiac catheterization and he was placed
on a heparin drip throughout his admission.
.
# Sleep apnea: His sleep apnea was medically managed with his
CPAP mask at night without complications.
.
The patient was full code for this admission. Pt was discharged
home with further outpt follow-up planned.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were initially admitted to the hospital for loss of
consciousness, and were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm
called ventricular tachycardia.  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management of your ventricular tachycardia and
evaluation for potential ablation.  Unfortunately, the site of
the abnormal heart rhythm could not be localized for ablation on
this attempt. Your pacemaker/defibrillator settings were
adjusted to optimize your own normal heart rhythm and
conduction.  You felt significantly improved following the
adjustment, and it was decided that your irregular heart rhythm
would be controlled with medications. We required you to stay in
the hospital for a few days  to best optimize your medications
for rhythm control.

During this hospitalization, we also began the evaluation for a
heart transplant in case this is something that might benefit
you in the future.

Other issues on this hospitalization included a rash involving
your chest, shoulders and neck.  It was believed to be related
to contact allergy to "chlorhexidine", a cleaning [**Doctor Last Name 360**] we
commonly use before procedures.  We also believe this skin rash
became secondarily infected, for which we treated you with
antibiotics.

The following changes were made to your home medications:
- Amiodarone was continued at 400mg TWICE daily for 3 more days,
then decrease to 400 mg once daily on [**2122-9-2**]. Please continue
that dose until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- Start Metoprolol Succinate to control your ventricular
tachycardia
- STOP taking Carvedilol, Magnesium and Digoxin
- DECREASE the dose of Warfarin to 4mg daily. Please check your
INR on Monday [**8-3**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- Start taking clindamycin, an antibiotic, to prevent infection
at the ICD site
- Start taking Tylenol as needed for pain at the ICD site
- Start taking Lorazepam if you need for anxiety or sleep.

Please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up
more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.

Check your INR at Dr.[**Name (NI) 87185**] office on Monday [**8-3**]. You should
have the INR followed closely now that you are on amiodarone.

Please be sure to have your blood drawn at your doctor's office
in [**11-22**] months to check your thyroid and liver function tests
because amiodarone can sometimes affect these with time. You
will also need to have pulmonary function tests done to make
sure the amiodarone is not affecting your lungs.

Your initial CT scan of your chest here showed that you have
some non-specific nodules that may be due to an infection,
inflammatory disease, or even cancer.  Please talk to your
primary care doctor and cardiologist regarding ordering a follow
up CT of your chest in [**2-24**] weeks to evaluate whether there is
any change.
