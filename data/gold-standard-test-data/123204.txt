Date of Birth:  [**2105-9-9**]             Sex:   F

Service: EMERGENCY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxemia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation
arterial/venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo F with h/o metastatic breast CA on chemotherapy who
initially was admitted to the OMED service with diarrhea who is
now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and hypoxia. Patient
states she had been feeling constipated for 1 week after chemo
on [**6-6**] and then took laxatives until she had several large BMs.
A few days later she develope large volume, non-bloody dairrhea
that was associated with some lightheadedness. She denied
fevers, chills, rashes. Reports poor appetite but states she was
drinking lot of water and trying to eat salty foods; however
this was limited by worsening mucositis over the past few days.
Due to concern for dehydration and contniued diarrhea, the
patient was admitted directly from the oncology clinic.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, pt AF with BP 120/74, HR 116, RR 24,
O2 sat 94% 2L NC. She was given 2L IVFs, started on po flagyl
empirically for c. diff adn had stool cultures sent for possible
OIs. Upon vitals check at 0400, pt's BP noted to be 78/54, HR
98, RR 20s, O2 sat 86% RA --> 93% 3L NC. Given 500 cc IVF bolus
X 2 with response in SBP to 86/40s, however, RR rose to upper
20-30s with O2 sats 90% 6L NC --> 95% NRB. ABG 7.51/25/114/21.
CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema with worsening bilateral
pleural effusions and possible retrocardiac opacity. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where code status was confirmed as full
and pt was intubated. Peri-intubation required dopamine at 20
mcg/kg/min, which was transitioned over to levophed gtt once
triple lumen catheter placed.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1617**] was previously treated for breast cancer in the
late [**2153**]. At that time she was diagnosed with a left-sided
infiltrating ductal carcinoma on [**2160-7-30**]. Repeat biopsy
showed persistent DCIS, and she underwent left mastectomy on
[**2160-9-20**]. Two of three lymph nodes were involved. She was
treated with 6 cycles of adjuvant oral CMF chemotherapy, which
completed in [**2161**], and then eight years of tamoxifen as the
tumor was ER positive, PR negative. Since that
time Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] was also diagnosed with a left renal cell
carcinoma and underwent partial nephrectomy in 03/[**2178**]. Her
medical course has been complicated by coronary artery disease
status post MI in [**9-/2179**] and atrial fibrillation. More
recently, a CT of the chest noted ground-glass abnormalities,
raising concern for bronchoalveolar carcinoma. This has not been
biopsied or formally diagnosed. In [**2-/2182**] liver function
studies were noted to be elevated, and liver ultrasound and
abdominal CT showed numerous lesions in the liver. CT-guided
core liver biopsy on [**2182-2-25**] showed metastatic breast
adenocarcinoma staining positive for mammoglobin, negative for
GCDFP, ER, and PR. The tumor overexpressed HER-2/neu. Tumor
markers drawn on [**2182-2-18**] were elevated with CEA 20 ng/mL and
CA 27.29 278 u/mL. PET scan performed on [**2182-3-6**] showed
numerous heterogeneous liver lesions, sclerotic lesions in the
left anterior rib and right ilium that were FDG avid and
concerning for metastatic foci, and FDG avid left pelvic side
wall lymph node. On [**2182-3-20**] mammogram and ultrasound of the
right breast showed a 1.9-cm right breast nodule. Pathology from
a core breast biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma grade I
that was HER-2/neu negative and ER/PR positive. Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**],
therefore, appears to have a new right breast tumor that is
ER/PRpositive, HER-2/neu negative, and liver metastases that are
ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu positive. She began Herceptin on
[**2182-4-16**], and Navelbine was added on [**2182-6-6**]. Also had L
thoracocentesis in [**5-11**] with malignant cells (adenocarcinoma) on
cytology.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-3-19**],
biventricular systolic funciton is now significantly depressed.

.
RADIOLOGY:
LLE U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
.
CXR:
Comparison is made with prior study [**2182-5-10**].
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild left pleural effusion has
increased.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is mild
pulmonary edema.
There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Multiple surgical
clips are in the left upper quadrant abdomen. There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, Ms [**Known lastname 1617**] is a 76F with h/o metastatic breast CA C1D15
of navelbine/herceptin admitted with diarrhea and weakness,
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in septic shock, expired [**2-4**] overwhelming
GNR bacteremia.
.
# Septic shock: overwhelming GNR bacteremia w
cardiogenic/distributive/hypovolemic components in the setting
of febrile neutropenia. DDx for the infection included the gut
(given diarrhea) vs the lung vs other. Pt treated w aggressive
fluid resuscitation, dopamine, norepinepherine and vasopressin
pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics. TTE revealed decreased
LVEF confirming the suspicion of acute heart failure in the
setting of sepsis.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Hypoxia progressed relatively
rapidly in the setting of receiving IVFs, CXR with evidence
supporting pulmonary edema. Furthermore, pt's known malignant
pleural effusion appears to be worsening and is also likely
contributing. No known aspiration events. Given neutropenia and
other vitals concerning for sepsis, infection also remains on
differential. PE also considered, but less likely. Treated for
sepsis as above.
.
# Hyponantremia: Na 120, improved to 130 w fluid resuscitation.
Does have prior h/o hyponatremia. Suspect that hypovolemia is
primary etiology.
.
# Diarrhea: Possibly infectious etiology given neutropenia vs
could be [**2-4**] chemo. Given refractory hypotension in the setting
of sepsis, possibly developing ischemic colitis.
.
# Pancytopenia: likely [**2-4**] chemotherapy - neutropenic, anemic w
underlying combined iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic
disease. No evidence of hemolysis. Thrombocytopenia. Transfused
w pRBCs and FFP.
.
# Metastatic breast CA: With known mets to liver and likely to
lung and bone based off of PET scan and pleural fluid cytology.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: INR supratherapeutic on admission. Afib w
RVR on transfer to ICU in the setting of hypovolemia, sepsis and
pressors.
