Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial Effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial Window
Right Heart Catheterization and attempted Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 30 y/o F with h/o Depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder
who is admitted after Echo showed early sings of tamponade.
.
Patient was seen on [**2182-11-29**] at [**Hospital 191**] clinic with multiple
complains, including disphagia, dysuria and abdominal pain. A Ct
scan was done on [**2182-12-2**] that did not reveal any intraabdominal
pathologies, but it showed a large pericardial effusion. She had
an Echocardiogram on [**2181-12-4**] that showed + RA collapse, pulses
in clinic 15-20. BP 100/60, HR 100 so she was refered for
pericardiocentesis.
.
She reports that over last 6 weeks, she had join aches, fatigue,
sore thorat, + dry ocugh and low grade fevers. Over last 2
weeks, she had worsening shortness of breath on exertion,
feeling more fatigue while walking or going up stairs. Also
reports, increase orthopnea going from 2 to 5 pillows. She also
had ongoing episodic abdominal pain over last month. Diffusse,
not nausea of vomit. Intermittent loose stools.
.
In the cath lab, multiple attempts to acces fluid by subxiphoid
approach failed. Pressures RA 7, RV 18/1/6, PA 14/7/10, PCW 3.
Echo post procedure showed a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion with brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There was
also intermittent, localized (inferior RV free wall) RV
compression suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure
and/or early, focal tamponade.
.
Patient was transfer to CCU for monitoring.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. No urinary symptoms.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for + chest thitgness,
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea. No ankle edema.

[**2182-12-9**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-12-6**], the
pericardial effusion has resolved.
.
[**2182-12-6**] TTE: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There is
sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling
pressures or early tamponade. There is mild right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2181-12-4**], the pericardial effusion is similar in size;
however, left atrial chamber invagination is now present. In
addition, the right ventricvle appears somewhat more compressed
.
[**2182-12-4**] Cath: . Pericadial effusion without clinical signs of
tamponade
and with normal RA pressure.
2.  Unsuccesful pericardiocentesis. Multiple attempts to access
the
pericardial space using a subxiphoid approach were unsuccesful.
TTE
obtained during the procedure showed anterior collection but not
at apex
and beneath liver edge. Despite echo guidance, the operator was
still
unable to enter the pericardial space. The patient developed
left
shoulder pain during the procedure attempts that resolved with
removal
of the needle.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No clinical signs of tamponade, normal RA pressure.
2. Unsuccesful pericardiocentesis


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pericardial effusion: On admission the patient was taken to
cath lab for pericardiocentesis. During the procedure
pericardial fluid was failed to be obtained. Hemodynamics
inconsistent with tamponade physiology. The patient was admitted
to the CCU for continued monitoring. Repeat TTE [**12-7**] demonstrated
new LA and RV invagination. CT surgery was consulted and the
patient was taken for pericardial window. She tolerated the
procedure well with no complications. Drain and chest tube
placed during procedure. Removed on [**12-10**] after repeat TTE on [**12-10**]
demonstrated a normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and normal systolic function and a resolution of
pericardial fluid. Her pericardial fluid was of unclear
etiology. Rheumatology was consulted and her sulfasalazine was
discontinued for concern of drug induced lupus given effusion
and decreasing WBC. WBC did stabalize after stopping medication.
Also concern for collagen vascular disease. Panel of autoimmune
antibodies pending at time of discharge. Cytology and
pericardial biopsy also pending at time of discharge. [**Doctor First Name **] to
evaluate for TB as cause pending. The patient did report recent
URI symptoms, can consider pericarditis as cause of effusion.
EBV, CMV pending. HIV negative. She also reports a family
history of breast CA - recent mamogram WNL. The patient was
discharged home in good condition to follow up with her PCP and
rheumatology for further management.
.
# Hypotension - Pt BP range 80s-110 systolic. The patient does
have low BP at baseline. Reported recent poor po intake and
history of eating disorder. She received intermittent fluid
bolus, likely due to increased insensible losses. She also has a
history of increased urine output with lithium induced CRI.
.
# Psych: continued on home medications Abilify, Quetiapine
.
# Question of Psoriatic arthiritis: continued prednisone per
Rheumatology recommendation. Sulfasalazine DC'd due to concern
for drug induced lupus
.
# Vaginal Bleeding - During her hospitalization the patient
reported scant vaginal bleeding. She has been post-menopausal
for many years. She was advised to undergo further workup for
this bleeding as outpatient. Given her past history of sexual
abuse she has reported refusing previous pelvic examination.
.
# Fibromyalgia: continued tizanidine and Ultram

# CKD: creatinine at baseline.
.
The patient is scheduled to follow up with Cardiology, CT
surgery, Rheumatology and her PCP for further management. Also
to follow up on outstanding pericardial fluid cytology and
biopsy, as well as pending Autoimmune workup.
