MICROBIOLOGY
Urine cx (-) x3.  Blood cx x2 negative at time of d/c.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69 yo Cantonse speaking female who presented with letargy,
gait abnormality and a serum sodium of 104. In ED she was found
to have obstructive uropathy resolving with foley placement. Of
note she has been of HCTZ/Triamtrene for number of years as
treatment of her HTN.

1. Hyponatremia: Pt with profound hyponatremia thought likely
secondary to her diuretic use. In the ED she appeared dry on
exam.  The patient had an initial FeNa of 4.91 and a urine Na of
26 which was consistent with renal losses and inconsistent with
SIADH.  In the ED she received one liter of normal saline and
her sodium increased from the nadir of 104 to 121 by the time of
arrival to the ICU.  She was not given any more saline at that
time, and her sodium was monitored while tolerating a regular
diet. It slowly increased to 127, she was noted to have global
hyporeflexia but no other neurological deficits at time of
transfer to the floors.   Pt was monitored and all IVFs were
held, as her sodium level slowly increased to normal on HD#5.
It was thought that her neurogenic bladder caused a decrease in
GFR, and a build of thiazide diuretic which led to her severe
hyponatremia.  Once a Foley was placed in the [**Name (NI) **], pt was able to
urinate and auto-correct, and her sodium drifted to normal with
minimal intervention.  No neurologic sequelae was seen due to
the correction of her sodium during this admission.  Pt was
instructed at discharge to never restart her thiazide diuretic
as this alone may have precipitated her severe hyponatremia.
.
2. Urine outflow obstruction:
It remained unclear what caused her initial neurogenic bladder
and bladder residual of 1700cc at time of admission.  It was
thought that perhaps a medication effect, whether OTC medication
or anticholinergic benadryl in cough syrup, that perhaps
contributed to her neurogenic bladder.  Pt was attempted
multiple voiding trials on HD#5 and HD#7 but each time patient
had PVR of >700cc, and the Foley was reinserted.  Urology was
consulted who recommended leaving the Foley in place for 1 week
after discharge, and to f/u with urology in 1 week for voiding
trial at that time.  A spinal MRI perfomed at this admission did
not show mass or any cord compression that would lead to urinary
retention.
.
3. Cough: She developed a productive cough with mild hemoptysis
at time of transfer to the floors, this was associated with a
fever of 101 the night prior. She was therefore contained on
precautions and ruled out for TB, although with no history of TB
and no evidence of opacities on chest xray
.
4. Renal Failure:
ARF on admission with Cr 1.8 due to obstructive uropathy,
resolved with Foley placement, returning to 0.9 on discharge.
Renal u/s with R>L hydro appears to be resolving.
.
5. HTN: normotensive on presentation to the ED. Pt's previous
cardizem and dyazide were stopped, and patient was started on
Metoprolol for BP control.  Pt was instructed to never restart
her dyazide diuretic.
.
