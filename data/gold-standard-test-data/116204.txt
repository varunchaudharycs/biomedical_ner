Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

intubation, arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old female with history of bronchiectasis and
COPD as well as cardiomyopathy secondary to cardiac contusion
and atrial fibrillation who was transferred for persistent
hypoxic respiratory failure after an admission to [**Hospital **]
Hospital.

The patient's history this year has been marked for starting
amioadarone in [**Month (only) 958**] for persistent atrial fibrilllation (also
had TEE and cardioversion) and had stayed in sinus rhythm.
Unfortunately, in [**Month (only) **] the patient developed worsening
cough and dyspnea and her amiodarone was stopped due to concern
for early pulmonary toxicity.  On [**9-23**] the patient was admitted
to [**Location (un) **] Hospial with worsening respiratory symptoms,
including dyspnea, cough, and hypoxia.  She had a chest CT on
[**9-25**] that revealed diffuse GGO on a background of
bronchiectasis and emphysema.  She started empiric treatment
with abx and steroids for concern of AIP.  Given progressive
respiratory failure she was intubated.  At the time of
bronchoscopy she had bloody secretions and there was concern for
pulmonary hemorrhage.  Therefore she was taken off
anticoagulation.  She was continued on antibiotics
(amp-sublactam and azithromycin) and steroids, her
anticoagulation was stopped, and she was also diuresed gently to
keep steadily negative fluid balances.  She had mild
improvements and was extubated on [**10-2**].  Unfortunately, since
extubation she had progressive supplementary O2 requirements and
spent the last few days prior to transfer bouncing between 100%
NRB mask and CPAP. She has had no positive cultures and
bronchoscopy revealed no organisms and no pathognomonic findings
for a particular diagnosis.  OSH course was also notable for
persistent and difficult to control afib with RVR so that on
transfer she was on high doses of diltiazem, metoprolol, and
digoxin.  Given her ? pulmonary hemorrhage the patient's primary
pulmonologist strongly felt she should not be anticoagulated
again and wanted transfer partially to pursue AV nodal ablation
or other more advanced RVR management by our EP service.

On arrival, vital signs were 96.1 (axillary), HR 88 (afib),
131/65, and satting 95% on non-rebreather. The patient was
awake, alert, responding appropriately to questioning. Reports
that her breathing is "a little labored," but feels better than
she had at the OSH.

Past Medical History:
- Cardiomyopathy after chest contusion with former EF 30%, now
normalized at 55%
- CAD, s/p BMS to RCA in [**10/2181**]
- Upper lobe bronchiectasis attributed to severe pneumonias in
the [**2132**]. Typically has 2-3 episodes of exacerbation
bronchiectasis each year.
- COPD with moderately severe centrilobular emphysema on CT
- Hypertension
- T2DM
- Mitral Valve Prolapse
- R breast nodularites (stable on subsequent mammograms)
- Plantar Fasciitis
- s/p partial hysterectomy in [**2142**]
- Bladder suspension
- GERD
- Multinodular goiter

Social History:
Former smoker, x 30 years at about two packs/day. Stopped seven
years ago. Occasional social alcohol. Lives at home alone, is
independent in ADLs. Two children are involved in her health
care.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death (three brothers who died of CAD and one sister
with CHF).

OTHER STUDIES

Admission ECG:

Chest Radiograph [**2183-10-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
Dense bilateral reticular opacities. This may represent an acute
process
superimposed on background chronic changes. The differential
diagnosis
includes drug-related pneumonitis (by report, the patient is on
amiodarone), interstitial edema, and interstitial infection.
Edema is considered less likely given the absence of effusions.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2183-10-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower extremity DVTs, more extensive on
the right
involving the common femoral vein, proximal and distal
superficial femoral
veins and posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Partially
occlusive thrombus
within the distal left superficial femoral vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
 80 y/o F with likely emphysema and bronchiectasis as well as
Afib w/ RVR and history of cardiomyopathy presenting with
worsening respiratory symptoms and hypoxia in the context of
bilateral ground glass infiltrates of uncertain etiology.

Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with very
high oxygen requirements and desatting with minimal exertion or
very short periods off the high flow oxygen masks. Unclear
ultimate etiology though diffuse findings on CT were thought to
be concerning for AIP on baseline lung disease with pulmonary
hemorrhage thought much less likely given reports of bleeding.
Patient had already received a fairly high pulse of steroids
leaving the benefit of another course questionable but given
tenuous respiratory status limiting ability to perform further
diagnostic work-up (particular any attempts to pursue tissue
diagnosis) a dose of 1 gram methylprednisolone daily was
initiated for three days followed by 1 mg/kg daily. She was also
started on vancomycin and cefepime given neither vancomycin nor
psuedomonas had been covered by here previous antibiotics and
those could be established in her altered airways as a not
uncommon cause of pneumonia.  Also patient was found to have
DVT's as described elsewhere, which were treated in hopes of
helping hypoxia.  Patient received levalbuterol and ipratroprium
nebulizers.  Eventually a bronchoscopy was done and did not show
evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.  However, the patient's
oxygenation became more and more problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and she was
intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Her ventilator
requirements continued to escalate.

Intracranial hemorrage:  While on a heparin drip for DVT, the
patient was noted to have anisocoria.  Head CT revealed large
parenchymal hemorrhage apparently centered in the right corona
radiata or that caudate nucleus, with transependymal dissection
into both lateral ventricles, and the third and fourth
ventricles.  The patient's  poor prognosis was explained to her
family.  The decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.

Deep Vein Thromboses: On presentation given patient's refractory
hypoxia an lack of good options decision was made to pursue some
work up for VTE given she was thought to be too unstable for CT
Scan but this could contribute to hypoxia.  Lower extremity
ultrasounds revealed DVT and she was started on heparin gtt.
Presumably, DVT's were developed during OSH course after
warfarin was stopped.

Atrial fibrillation: Patient was well rate controlled at arrival
on dilt 90 QID, metoprolol tartrate 50 TID and dig, given some
pauses (2-2.5 seconds) on the night after admission and
generally good rate control. Later in her course her rate became
more rapid and she briefly requiring diltiazem gtt.  Heparin
drip was continued as above.

CAD, Cardiomyopathy: Patient had an EF of 30 with a cardiac
contusion per past reports but now normalized to 55.  Echo
showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function and biatrial
enlargement. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertensionShe was
continued on her aspirin, simvastatin, and beta blocker for her
history of CAD.
.
Hypotension: Initially normotensive on rate control agents. Also
on daily furosemide.  On the day of intubation, she also became
hypotensive requiring initiation of norepinephrine
.
Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Mildly hyperglycemic on arrival. On
oral agents at home, fingersticks with ISS at OSH.  SS insulin
was continued.
.
Code status:  initially full, later comfort measures only
