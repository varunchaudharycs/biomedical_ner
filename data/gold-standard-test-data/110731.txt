REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   assess for any residual blood
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: DMFj MON [**2179-4-5**] 8:19 PM
Persistent left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma with areas
of increased
density suggestive of ongoing bleeding. Persistent shift of
normally midline
structures to the right of 6 mm. Close followup recommended.


Final Report
STUDY: CT of the head without contrast.

HISTORY: 72-year-old male with subdural hematoma. Assess for
residual blood.

COMPARISONS: CT [**2179-4-2**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the head were obtained.

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of an intracranial
catheter. The
patient is status post left frontal craniotomy. A mixed
attenuation
collection overlies primarily the left frontoparietal convexity.
There are
areas of increased attenuation within this collection, which
suggest ongoing
bleeding. Several areas of pneumocephalus are compatible with
recent
craniotomy. The total diameter of this collection measures
approximately 11
mm, which is slightly larger compared to the previous
measurements of 8 mm
allowing for slight differences in technique. There is
persistence of
adjacent sulcal enfacement, particularly notable superiorly
within the frontal
lobe. There is shift of normally midline structures to the right
of
approximately 6 mm, which is probably unchanged compared to the
previous shift
of 5 mm. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
appear
grossly clear. Multiple staples and subcutaneous emphysema are
noted along
the subcutaneous tissues overlying the left frontal bone and
site of
craniotomy.

IMPRESSION: Persistence of left extra-axial collection status
post catheter
removal with several areas of increased density suggestive of
ongoing
hemorrhage. Persistent shift of normally midline structures to
the right of
approximately 6 mm. Continued close followup is advised.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 742**] [**Name (STitle) **]


FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: There is diffuse mixed theta/delta frequency
slowing
seen broadly across the left hemisphere.
BACKGROUND: Showed generally a low voltage fast activity across
the
right hemisphere. The posterior predominant rhythm on the left
reached
an 8 Hz maximum.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness but
did
not achieve stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to persistent left hemisphere mixed slow wave
activity
indicative of an area of broad subcortical dysfunction in this
region.
There are no epileptiform features noted.

hemisphere on the elft.
Patent major itnra and extra cranial arteries without focal flow

stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the
resolution of MRA.



Final Report
INDICATION: 72-year-old man with new-onset dysarthria several
days after
craniotomy for SDH, to evaluate for vascular abnormalities.

COMPARISON: CT of the head done on [**2179-4-6**].

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head
was performed
without and with IV contrast. 3D TOF MR angiogram of the head,
contrast-
enhanced MR angiogram of the neck were performed, MIP
reformations of the
arteries were obtained.

FINDINGS:

MRI OF THE HEAD: The left-sided convexity based subdural
hematoma is again
visualized, with small amount of air and mild displacement of
the cerebral
parenchyma. There is also edema of the left cerebral hemisphere,
with
decrease in the size of the cerebral sulci, the overall
appearance not
significantly changed compared to the prior CT study done on
[**2179-4-6**], allowing
for the differences in the modalities. There are multiple small
FLAIR
hyperintense foci noted in the cerebral white matter on both
sides, in the
frontal and the parietal lobes, periventricular and subcortical
in location.
There are no areas of restricted diffusion in the brain
parenchyma. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear. Small
areas of
increased signal intensity are noted in the left mastoid air
cells from
mucosal thickening/fluid.

3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: The left vertebral artery is
dominant. The
right posterior cerebral artery and the P1 and P2 segments are
slightly
tortuous with tortuous course of the junction of the P1 and P2
segments. The
P1 segment on the left side is not visualized, with a fetal PCA
pattern. The
A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery is slightly
small in caliber
and likely hypoplastic. The anterior communicating artery is
faintly
visualized.

No areas of abnormal enhancement are noted in the brain
parenchyma.
Enhancement of the meninges, likely relates to the recent
surgery in the
subdural hematoma on the left side. The tip of the basilar
artery is slightly
prominent related to the infundibula at the origins of the
branch vessels.

MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: The origins of the arch vessels are
patent. There
is common origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left
common carotid
artery, representing bovine arch variant. There is mild
narrowing, at the
origin of the left vertebral artery, which may relate to
tortuosity or
stenosis. However, there is no flow limitation distally. The
right vertebral
artery is small in caliber diffusely likely related to mild
hypoplasia with
the left being dominant, the narrowing is more prominent at the
origin and v4
segment ; however, there is no flow limitation. The common
carotid arteries
are patent, as well as the cervical internal carotid arteries
without focal
flow- limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. There is a
short segment of
mild- moderate stenosis in the left common carotid artery, seen
only on the
MIPS and not on the source images and hecne is of doubtful
significance- no
flow limitation distally. (series 106, im 6; series 108, im 5)

The delayed phase images are not obtained on the MR angiogram.

IMPRESSION:

1. No acute infarction.

2. Small-to-moderate size left-sided subdural hematoma, with
small amount of
air, and mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere, with
edema, unchanged
compared to the most recent CT head study done on [**2179-4-6**].

3. Patent major intra- and extra-cranial arteries, without focal
flow-
limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm within the limitations
of MR
angiogram. Please see the additional details above.

4. Narrowing at the origin of the left vertebral artery,
question tortuosity,
or stenosis, no flow limitation distally; ? stenosis in the left
common
carotid artery- seen only on MIPS but not on source images; no
flow
limitation distally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 80675**] was admitted to the SICU for close observation and
prepared for a left sided cranitomy for evacuation of subdural
hematoma. On [**4-1**] he underwent a craniotomy.  Post operatively he
was monitored for 24 hours in the SICU his exam improved with no
drift or weakness. On his first post operative day he was
transferred to the surgical floor. He was tolerating a regular
diet, PT eval stated pt was safe to go home. However family was
uncomfortable taking pt home and was requesting rehab. During
evaluation for re-hab on POD 5 he then developed severe
dysarthria. Repeat head CT was unchanged and MRI/MRA of brain
and neck were negative for stroke. His EEG was also negative.
Over the next few days his speech/word finding improved. He did
wax and wane with periods of aphasia and normal speech. There
was concern for seizure so a 24hr EEG was done and shows normal
activity.  CT scan on day of discharge [**2179-4-12**] = stable.
Staples and sutures were removed from crani site.  Site without
erythema. Plan is for discharge home today with [**Name (NI) 269**] - pt and
family agree with this plan.  His exam remains non-focal.
