Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, increased abdominal girth,

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Tracheostomy Placement
2. PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 yo M with h/o DM2, CAD s/p recent hospitalization for
rhabdomyolyis and myopathy presenting with weakness. Pt states
that since d/c on [**8-9**] he has experienced progressively
worsening weakness. He states that he has the most difficulty
getting out of chair, changing clothes, not as much weakness at
the wrists or ankle. No diplopia or blurry vision, no dysphagia,
no headache or jaw pain. Pt denies any myalgias, no
paraesthesis. On the previous hospitalization his cholesterol
lowering agents were discontinued as it was thought that these
could be the possible culprits for rhabdomyolysis. During that
hospitalization neurology was consulted, and work up included nl
TSH, elevated ESR, negative [**Doctor First Name **]. Pt's health has been
deteriorating over the past year in the setting of a chronic
post surgical would infection at the left foot requiring most
recently vancomycin. He was started on zyvox 4 days prior to
this presentation. Of note, during his prior hospitalization he
complained of SOB and had an oxygen requirement. Echo
demonstrated an EF of % and it was felt that he possibly had
diastolic heart failure. He responded to gentle diuresis with
subjective improvement in symptoms. Pulmonary was consulted at
that time and recommended outpt sleep study. His hospital course
results were also remarkable for persistently elevated LFTs. An
MRI was planned to further evaluate but pt was unable to fit in
MRI due to abdominal girth.
.
In the ED his labs were notable for elevated CK to < [**Numeric Identifier 4731**]. This
was higher than the CK max at the prior hospitalization. He was
given 1L NS.
.
ROS: positive for mild SOB which he says is unchanged since
discharge - overall improved over the past month since starting
diuretics; denies CP/palp/cough/diarrhea/rash.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:



RIGHT DELTOID MUSCLE BIOPSY (including snap-frozen tissue):

Acute, recent, and chronic myopathy (chronic active myopathy)

Acute myofiber necrosis.

Scattered degenerating and regenerating myofibers and scattered
myophagocytosis, indicative of recent myofiber injury.

Increased endomysial connective tissue, increased frequency of
internalized nuclei, and scattered split myofibers, indicative
of chronic myopathy.

Scattered CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, without direct association
with pathologic changes.

Coarse lipid and mitochondrial staining in degenerating
myofibers.

NOTE:

In addition to the findings identified in the preliminary
report, these special stains identify coarse lipid staining in
many of the degenerating myofibers, along with corresponding
changes in mitochondria. While not specific, they are consistent
with a metabolic myopathy affecting lipid metabolism, as can be
induced by toxic agents and several drugs. They are consistent
with effects of some cholesterol lower agents, especially
combinations of agents in elderly patients. Diagnostic changes
of an inflammatory myositis are not identified in this biopsy.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

H&E stain: increased internalized nuclei and split myofibers;
scattered myophagocytosis and frequent degenerating and
regenerating myofibers, including atrophic basophilic fibers;
moderate to marked variation in myofiber size; frequent small,
round or angulated myofibers; scattered acutely necrotic
myofibers having pale eosinophilic staining

Gomori trichrome stain: increased endomysial connective tissue
in sites of greatest degeneration; no ragged red fibers;
degenerating myofibers often show coarse staining of
sarcoplasmic mitochondria

PAS stain: normal distribution of glycogen

PAS + diastase stain: no diastase-resistant glycogen

Oil red "O" stain: coarse staining of degenerating myofibers

NADH histochemistry: coarse staining of degenerating myofibers
in a mitochondrial pattern (mitochondrial clumping)

ATPase (pH 4.3, 4.6, 9.5) histochemistry: type I myofiber
predominant; atrophic myofibers of both types - predominantly
type II; no diagnostic type grouping.

CD3 immunoperoxidase: non-contributory

CD4 immunoperoxidase: scattered T4 lymphocytes throughout
specimen; not directly associated with individual myofiber
injury

CD8 immunoperoxidase: scattered T8 lymphocytes throughout
specimen; not directly associated with individual myofiber
injury

CD68 immunoperoxidase: non-contributory

Factor VIII immunoperoxidase: normal numbers of vessels,
including endomysial capillaries


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
64yo man with h/o TIIDM, CAD, Afib, and Gout, presenting  with
myositis vs rhabdomyalysis, transferred now with tachypnea and
hypercapnia and acidemia.
.
#  Respiratory failure  Poor ventilation due to progressive
muscle weakness.  Rising PCO2 and respiratory acidemia
progressed to hypercarbic respiratory failure.  No evidence of
primary pulmonary process.
-  Pt intubated for worsening ventilation/oxygenation in setting
of worsening weakness
-  Remained intubated due to poor NIFs.  Very brief SBT failed
when pt had no respiratory effort.
-Given continued poor respiratory muscle strength, likelihood of
lengthy intubation, percutaneous tracheostomy performed on
[**2133-9-1**] and trach placed.  Complicated trach placement due to
subcutaneous emphysema on same day of trach placement.  Incision
site was widened and subcutaneous emphysema and swelling
decreased over the next two days.  No pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum seen on CXR.
.
#  Myospathy:  rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, pathololgy from muscle
biopsy suggests myopathic changes, possibly drug-induced.
Rheumatology and neurology consulted.  Not thought that steroids
will help this disease process.  Off statins, will follow CK and
clinical picture, await gradual recovery.
.
#  ARF:  contrast nephropathy, ATN on chronic diabetic
nephrophathy.  patient briefly anuric.  Hemodialyzed, but now
with improving renal function, increased urine output, no
further need for dialysis at this time.
.
#  Transaminitis:  LFTs returned to NL; likely due to rhabdo.
hepatitis serologies negative.  CTA abdomen nondiagnostic
.
#  Foot wound:  patient completed 10days Linezolid per podiatry
recc's.  Podiatry following.
.
#  TIIDM: RISS + NPH for elevated blood sugars.
.
#  HTN:  metoprolol
.
#  FEN:  diabetic, cardiac diet; PEG placed on [**9-8**]
.
#  PPx:  SC heparin, po diet
.
#  Access:  PICC
