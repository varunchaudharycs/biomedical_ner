Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, diaphoresis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy and 3.0x23 mm Cypher
[**First Name3 (LF) **] to proximal LAD


History of Present Illness:
56yoF PMH of htn, DMII, dyslipidemia, presented to [**Hospital1 6591**] afternoon [**7-29**] with a chief complaint of sudden onset
substernal chest pain on extertion.  On arrival, to the OSH, an
EKG was performed which deomonstrated ST depressions in II, III,
AVF and ST elevations V1-V4. She was given asa, nitrogliceryn,
integrelin and heparin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, the patient was shown to have a thrombotic
subtotal occlusion of the LAD at the Septal-1 branch.
Thrombectomy was performed and a 3.0x23mm Cypher [**Hospital1 **] was placed
in the proximal LAD with good flow documented post procedure.
Given 40mg IV lasix for PCWP>30. The patient had been nauseated
but this seemed to increase post cath, with several episodes of
emesis. The patient was given 300mg of plavix as concern that pt
vomited up plavix load from prior to cath.  While initially
clear, the emesis was noted to become blood tinged after several
bouts in cath lab.
.
On arrival to CCU post-cath, vitals were BP 111/93, hr 86 and a
temp of 95.6.  The patient was nauseated w/hemoptemesis x2.  She
was oriented x3.  An NGT was placed and gastric lavage with 1 L
of saline showed blood, which cleared to pink/blood tinged by
last aliquot.

CARDIAC CATH [**2196-7-30**]:
R dominant, single vessel coronary artery disease.  LMCA no
apparent flow-limiting dz.  LAD had thrombotic subtotal
occlusion near the Septal-1 branch, TIMI II flow in LAD.  Small
D1 had 80% ostial stenosis.  LCx and RCA had minimal luminal
irregularities.  Mildly elevated R-sided filling pressure with
RVEDP 15 mmHg and elevated left sided filling pressure PCWP 35
mmHg.  Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure
of 44/32 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was 131/89 mmHg.  The
cardiac index was low at 1.8 L/min/m2.
3. Successful manual thrombectomy and placement of a 3.0x23mm
Cypher drug-eluting stent were performed in the proximal LAD.
Final
angiography showed TIMI III flow, no apparent dissection, and no

residual stenosis.  (See PTCA comments)
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Mild right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Reduced cardiac index.
6. Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the proximal LAD.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 56 year old female with a history of hypertension,
dyslipidemia, cerebral aneurysm clip presented with STEMI, had
[**Month/Day/Year **] placed in [**Hospital 54969**] transferred to CCU with course complicated by
post-procedure bloody vomitus with need for Plavix reload, was
tachycardic into the 100's overnight.
.
# CAD/ischemia:  Patient presented to the hospital with
substernal chest pain on exertion.  Patient was found to have ST
depressions in II, III, AVF and ST elevations V1-V4.  Patient
was sent to the cath lab, where she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] placed in
the LAD territory.  After the procedure, the patient remained
persistently tachycardic.  She was given multiple doses of
Metoprolol IV and was started on Toprol XL 50 mg, to which her
pulse decreased.  Patient was started on Atorvastatin 80 mg
daily, ASA 325 mg daily, Captopril 6.25 mg TID, and Plavix 75 mg
daily.  She was discharged on 2.5 mg Lisinopril daily.  Patient
did not have any acute events relating to her CAD while she was
in the hospital, and she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79466**] on
[**2196-8-9**].  Please consider checking homocysteine level as an
outpatient.
.
# Hematemesis:  Patient reported nausea at time of chest pain.
Upon admission to CCU, patient denied chest pain but had three
episodes of bloody vomitus (quantity <40cc each episode).  NG
lavage showed red blood on drawback.  Integrilin was held, but
the patient continued to receive her Plavix.  GI was consulted,
and the patient did not have any further episodes of
hematemesis.  The patient's Hct dropped to 28.1 and remained at
that level for the remainder of her hospital stay.
.
# Type 2 Diabetes:  Patient's glucose was 247 on admission,
though this was in the setting of acute stress.  Patient had a
HgA1c checked on this admission, which was 6.4%.  Patient was
placed on a sliding scale insulin while in the hospital.
Patient was advised to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding this
issue.
.
# Smoking Cessation:  Patient was counseled on smoking cessation
during this hospital stay.  She was given Nicotine lozenges, but
the patient stated that she was interested in waiting until her
current cardiac issue had resolved before attempting to quit
smoking.  Patient was advised to follow-up on this issue with
her PCP.
