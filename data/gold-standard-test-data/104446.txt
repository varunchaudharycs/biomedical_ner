None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 74-year-old gentleman with a  pmhx. significant for
dCHF, afib on coumadin, CKD, MSSA/GBS bacteremia, and was
recently discharged on [**2143-12-19**] for compression fracture of T11
vertebrea and afib with RVR who presents to the ED at the
request of his nurse practioner for elevated potassium.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 19829**] had been evaluated in the infectious disease clinic on
[**12-25**] and had routine labs drawn, at which time his potassium was
found to be 5.7.  He was told to go to the ED that night for
evaluation, but decided to come in the next day.  Patient denies
any particular complaints but does complain of fatigue.  No
headache, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other
concerning signs or symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.3 120 105/72 22 100% RA.
Labs were significant for a creatinine of 3.3 up from a baseline
of 1.5 and a potassium of 6.1.   Patient complained of wheezing
and chest congestion and received a dose of levaquin for
presumed HCAP.  He also received nebs, 15grams of kayexalate and
250cc of fluid.  Mr. [**Known lastname 19829**] was transferred to the MICU for
further evaluation and work-up.

Past Medical History:

TEE
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate
([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mitral and aortic leaflets are thickened but no
discrete vegetation is identified. No abscess seen.
.
TTE:
MPRESSION: Aortic leaflet thickened with mild aortic
regurgitation but no discrete vegetation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation with thickened leaflets but without discrete
vegetation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
MRI TSpine/LSpine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No osteomyelitis, discitis or epidural abscess.
2. Interval subacute T11 compression fracture without
retropulsion.
3. Interval progression of the known L1 compression fracture,
but without
retropulsion.
4. Low lumbar degenerative changes, without spinal stenosis.
.
[**2143-12-27**]
Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
mediastinal and
hilar contours. Stable mild cardiomegaly evident. Increased
opacity
overlying the right diaphragm on background of right lower lung
atelectasis,
may indicate pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
evident.
Stable L1 and T12 compression fractures. Stable degenerative
changes of the
right shoulder.

IMPRESSION: Increased opacity of right lower lung may reflect
worsening
atelectasis, though in proper clinical setting, pneumonia is a
possibility.
No pleural effusion evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx significant for
recent MSSA and group G strep bactremia, dCHF, asthma, and afib
on coumadin who was admitted after routine lab tests showed an
elevated potassium.  He was found to be bacteremic on admission.
A work-up for the source was inconclusive. He was discharged
with a PICC line for likely 6 weeks of vancomycin therapy.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURES: Blood cultures from [**12-27**] to [**12-29**] grew
methicillin resistant staph. epidermis. Source search included
evaluation for valvular vegetations included TTE and TEE which
were unrevealing. Given history of compression fractures an MRI
T and L spine showed no source.  A RUQ ultrasound was obtained
in setting of right upper extremity edema and pain on palpation
of the axilla revealed evidence of a non occlusive clot. In
setting of atopic dermatitis, multiple skin lesions and recent
knee injury with slow healing wound, skin source entertained.  A
picc line was placed and 4-6 weeks of vancomycin will be
continued at discharge dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with creatinine of 3.3 up from a
baseline of 1.5.  On admission, patient was 89 kg, down from
94.9kg on [**2143-12-16**].  He appeared hypovolemic with increased
thirst, and BUN/creatinine ratio is >20.  Urine lytes
demonstrated FeUrea < 34 (25) consistent with pre-renal
etiology.  After administration of IVF, renal function improved
with discharge creatinine 1.1. AIN possibly contributed given
recent treatment with Nafcillin.  Urine eosinophils were
positive.  Valsartan and lasix were initially held. Valsartan
was restarted prior to discharge and lasix was restarted at a
lower dose 40mg.
.
# HYPERKALEMIA:  Likely in the setting of dehydration, renal
failure, and valsartan.  With fluids and kayexalate, patient's
potassium trended down.
.
# SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  Differential includes asthma
exacerbation vs. pneumonia vs. bronchitis vs. volume overload.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19829**] was given a prednisone burst ( 5 days of 40mg
prednisone) with significant improvement in his symptoms.  His
Advair was increased to 500/50 and he was started on Singulair.

.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
# AFIB WITH RVR:  Metoprolol, diltiazem and coumadin were
continued during admission.
.
# HTN:  Metoprolol and dlitiazem was continued.
.
# ATOPIC DERMATITIS:  Hydroxyzine and clobetasol were continued
during admission.
.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You came because of high
potassium. Your potassium was high because your kidneys were not
functioning as they usually do. We gave you fluid and held
diuretics for few days and your kidney function came back to the
baseline. While you were in the hospital we found a bacteria in
your blood. Therefore we had to give you intravenous antibiotics
that you have to continue at home for 6 weeks.

We have done the following changes to your medication:
TAKE VANCOMYCIN 750 mg intarvenously  through the PICC line
twice a day. Home service will come to help you.
CHANGE furosemide 60 mg daily to furosemide 40 mg daily

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
