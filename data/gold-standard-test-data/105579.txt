HPI: 44yo man with h/o hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis
presenting with hypotension. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Date range (1) 63738**] with chest pain, hypertensive urgency, and
diastolic CHF. Hospital course was complicated by hematemesis

A/P: 44yo man with h/o HTN, ESRD on HD presenting with
hypotension
.
#. Hypotension: This episode of hypotension is most likely due
to hypovolemia c/b medication effect as it occurred after the
patient was dialyzed and then took five new medications
simultaneously at max dose. If hypotension persists, would need
to consider cardiac ischemia, CHF, sepsis, adrenal
insufficiency, but these seem less likely. Echo done during the
last hospitalization showed mild LVH, dilated LA, nml EF >55%.
- hold all antihypertensives; plan to add back slowly at reduced
doses and varying schedule
- rule out MI
- bolus NS to maintain MAP >60 with caution given ESRD and
oliguric
.
#. ESRD: M,W,F hemodialysis.
- will notify Renal team
- continue Renagel, calcium acetate
.
#. Metabolic alkalosis: There is no history of vomiting or
diuretic use. He does not have decreased ventiliation causing
hypercapnia, and thus this is not likely compensatory.
- recheck chemistries; consider ABG if persists
.
#. Hyperkalemia: Patient was dialyzed today. monitor closely and
give kayexelate if K+ rises further

Brief Hospital Course:
This 44 year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension,
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and illicit drug abuse.
 He had had a recent admission to this hospital for hypertensive
urgency presented to the emergency department with hypotension
after taking his 5 BP medication just subsequent to his dialysis
yesterday.  His blood pressure normalized after administration
of 2 boluses of 1L normal saline.  He was admitted to the
medicine service.  Throughout his brief stay, he remained
hemodynamically stable with blood pressure in the normotensive
range.  At no time did he exhibit signs of cardiogenic shock or
sepsis.  It was felt that his symptomatology and hypotension was
related to his taking blood pressure medications to soon after
his dialysis session.

It was felt that it was safe for the patient to go home.  He was
advised to not take any of his blood pressure medications in the
4 -6 hour time period after each dialysis session and given a
prescription and schedule to take two of his antihypertensive
medications in the morning, and two at night.  This was also
communicated to the attending physician that day, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 4154**] who agreed with this.  Discharge of patient was to be
arranged pending final evaluation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4154**].  The patient,
however, grew impatient saying he needed to be at work soon.  He
was given a letter excusing him from work and he seemed
satisfied with this and said he would wait for the attending.
The patient, however, did not wait for the attending's final
evaluation and subsequently left AMA soon thereafter.  Attending
was notified.

In summary this is a 44 year-old gentleman with hypertension and
end stage renal disease on hemodialysiswho presented with
hypotension after taking all four blood pressure medications
shorly after a hemodialysis session.  His hypotension resolved
and was hemodynamically stable upon leaving AMA.  Reasons for
leaving AMA, not entirely clear.  Issues and plan as follows:
.
1) Hypotension: Likely from taking BP medications too soon after
HD.  Given schedule for taking 2 medications in morning, two at
night.  Advised not to take antihypertensive medications at
least 4-6 hours after hemodialysis.
- ruled out for MI

.
2) ESRD: M,W,F hemodialysis.
- continue Renagel, calcium acetate
- Renal service notified.
.
3) Metabolic abnormalities: Alkalosis/hyperkalemia: K Trended
down to normal range, alkalosis resolved,  long term managment
with dialysis.

4) FEN: renal, low sodium diet
.
5) PPx: pneumoboots, Protonix
.
6) Full Code

7) Left AMA, reasons unclear.  It was safe for him to leave
although attending physician needed to see him for final
clearance.  Claimed he needed to return to work so given note
excusing him from work.  This did not prevent him from leaving
AMA.
