Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] is a 55 yo man w/ metastatic melanoma and known mets
to brain (incl cerebellum), who presents with one day of
headache and altered mental status.  History is obtained by the
patient's wife due to the patient being sedated from the ED.

Over the past few days prior to admission, the pt's wife notes
that he had not been sleeping well at night due to increased
urinary frequency.  However, other than feeling more tired
during the day he had been overall doing well. On the morning
prior to admission, the patient developed a severe headache,
associated with nausea and several episodes of bilious vomiting.
 He was unable to keep down any POs.  Additionally, he had
increasing confusion and agitation and so was taken to [**Hospital3 12748**]. In the ED there, head CT revealed hemorrhage
of some of his brain mets with 2mm midline shift and mild
hydrocephalus.  He received 8mg IV dexamethasone, 4mg IV
morphine x 2, and zofran.  [**Hospital1 18**] oncology fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and transfer was arranged.

Of note, pt has had 2 recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with nausea,
vomiting, dizziness and dehydration. This was felt to be due to
combination of Taxol and progression of CNS disease.  During
admission Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] was made aware that surgical resection of
the cerebellar metastasis may relieve these symptoms, however,
he has refused any kind of surgery on more than one occasion on
review of the medial record. He was placed on 4 mg every 8 hours
of dexamethasone and was discharged with home IV fluids and PICC
line on [**2118-7-19**].

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5, P 60, BP 166/90, R 15, O2
sat 98% RA. Patient was agitated, but not talking or answering
questions.  He was given 3mg of ativan for sedation to obtain a
repeat CT head.  He brady'd to the 30s after receiving sedation,
but HR improved up to low 100s spontaneously.  Repeat CT head
was reviewed by neurosurgery and showed no change from OSH
imaging, without hydrocephalus or risk for herniation.
Additionally, it was felt there was no significant change since
his last imaging 2 months ago.  Family declined surgical
intervention, per his prior wishes.  He was given decadron 10mg
IV and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is somnolent and unarousable
but appears comfortable.  His wife is at the bedside.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Metastatic melanoma: Onc hx adapted from recent onc clinic
note by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Location (un) **]:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision and left parotid neck
node dissection for a 6 mm thick melanoma of his left parietal
scalp in [**2116-7-3**], with 3 of 27 nodes being positive. He
received adjuvant interferon, but had a soft tissue recurrence
in the left neck a few months into therapy. This was resected
and interferon therapy was resumed post surgery until [**Month (only) 404**] of
[**2117**], when he developed contralateral neck soft tissue
recurrence treated with surgical resection and parotidectomy in
[**2117-4-3**]. Pathology revealed 4 of 8 nodes positive, and a
large lymph node measuring 1.7 cm in the parotid. His interferon
therapy was discontinued at this time. A PET CT scan in [**Month (only) 216**]
of [**2117**] revealed lung nodules and a 3.3 cm left inguinal mass.
Head MRI revealed a single brain metastasis in the right corona
radiata. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CyberKnife radiosurgery to this lesion in
[**2117-11-3**]. He began high dose IL2 in [**2117-12-4**],
without response. He developed deep vein thrombosis in [**Month (only) 404**]
of [**2118**], requiring Lovenox. Followup head MRI revealed disease
progression in the CNS. He was begun on CTLA4 antibody protocol
on [**2118-3-1**], with 6 week scan showing disease
progression, particularly in the CNS, and he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] whole
brain radiation therapy started on [**2118-4-12**]. He completed
a 4-week course of radiation on [**2118-4-22**]. Repeat CT scan
showed evidence of disease progression, particularly in the left
inguinal area. Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] surgical resection of a mass
in his left groin area in [**2118-5-4**]. Surgery was able to
remove the mass. Ventriculostomy [**2118-6-23**] for occlusive
hydrocephalus. Had first dose of taxol [**2118-6-28**].
2. s/p appendectomy as a child
3. Degenerative joint disease in the L5 area
4. Cervical neck surgery [**2112**]
5. DVT as above

CXR [**2118-8-13**]: New opacification at the right lung base
accompanied by a greater elevation of
the right hemidiaphragm could be atelectasis alone or
combination of
atelectasis and pneumonia, particularly aspiration. Large nodule
in the right
mid lung unchanged since [**Month (only) 547**]. Heart size normal. No
appreciable pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax.

EKG [**2118-8-14**]: Sinus tachycardia, rate 140. Vertical axis. Cannot
exclude inferior
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. S1-Q3-T3 pattern.
Consider
acute pulmonary embolism. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2118-8-14**]
sinus bradycardia has given way to sinus tachycardia and axis is
now vertical.
Also, non-specific inferolateral repolarization changes have
appeared.

HEAD CT [**2118-8-14**]: No new focus of hemorrhage. Overall unchanged
picture of hemorrhagic metastases.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Most likely multifactorial but
primarily from leptomeningeal involvement and hemorrhagic brain
metastases with contributions from over-sedation from home
benzodiazepines, PNA and UTI. On admission to the ICU patient
was quite sedated and only minimally responsive. Across his stay
he became more responsive and was able to follow commands, move
all extremities, and at times speak quite coherently, although
his mental status continued to wax and wane. During his
hospitalization he also developed a left sided facial droop
thought likely due to evolving brain metastases and
leptomeningeal involvement.

2. GOALS OF CARE/CODE STATUS: The patient code status was made
DNR/DNI during this admission and this was confirmed with the
patient's wife. A family meeting was held to discuss goals of
care, and it was decided to move towards hospice care after
discharge. The patient's wife, however, appeared to hold out
ongoing hope for the patient's recovery, and the patient himself
expressed the desire to attempt one more round of Taxol.
Discharged with home VNA and bridge to hospice.

3. METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEMORRHAGIC BRAIN METS: Known mets
to scalp, neck, groin, brain s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mass resection and
ventriculostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus. On Taxol at
admission, first dose 5/26.  In previous discussions, patient
has been clear that he did not desire further surgical
intervention for control of his brain mets. He repeatedly stated
his desire for one more attempt at treatment with Taxol, which
was decided against given the patient's disease progression
despite taxol therapy. Dexamethasone was continued for cerebral
edema and all anticoagulation was held.

4. FEVERS/PNA/UTI: Fever and CXR on admission with consolidation
at right base concerning for aspiration pneumonia, as well as
WBCs in U/A. No elevation of WBC. Started on Vanc/Zosyn later
changed to Vanc/Cefapime after blood cultures remained negative.
Urine Cx grew out enterococcus which was sensitive to
ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin.

5. NAUSEA/VOMITING: Likely related to leptomeningeal involvement
and metastatic impingement on fourth ventricle versus recent
chemo. No evidence of increased intracranial pressure on head CT
but during stay patient did develop left sided facial droop.
Could be related to vertigo in setting of additional brain edema
as in recent admission. He also has had dizziness and
lighthededness with standing and sitting up, and on previous
admission patient had orthostatic hypotension. Patient was
treated with Ondansetron and Decadron.

6. h/o DVT: Dx in [**2-11**]. Lovenox stopped on admission given
hemorrhagic brain mets.
