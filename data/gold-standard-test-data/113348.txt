Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower Back Pain with LE weakness beginning [**2133-6-8**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laminectomy T12-L2
Single wire pacemaker placed


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 59 y/o Cantonese female with a h/o Atrial fibrillation
and mechanical MVR (Bjork-Shiley) secondary to RHD experienced
low back pain and LE weakness beginning on [**2133-6-8**]. MRI of the
lumbar spine revealed a cystic mass at the T12-L2, which was
found to be a hematoma upon surgical exploration on [**2133-6-12**] and
was subsequently evacuated. Pt has been on Coumadin and digoxin
due to her cardiac hx and initially her INR was 3.5. During the
operation the pt experienced episodes of bradycardia with right
neck manipulation and swan-ganz catheter placement c/w vagal
etiology, however bradycardia and pauses continued for following
the surgery. Permanent v-lead pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**]. Pt
demonstrated NSVT believed to be d/t digoxin toxicity (1.1).
Currently pt c/o pain in right leg from the buttock down to the
ankle on the lateral calf, diminishing distally. No c/o CP other
than at the incision site for the pacemaker, no SOB, no LH.
Difficulty with using bedside commode due to pain and reports no
BM, but positive flatus.

MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Extramedullary hematoma, which may be intradural or
epidural, compressing the conus and cauda equina from T11/12
through L1/2. Associated large veins are suggestive of a
vascular malformation. If the hematoma is intradural, a spinal
cord arteriovenous malformation is likely. A conventional
angiogram is recommended for assessment of vascular
malformation. Follow-up lumbar spine MRI is also recommended to
evaluate the surgical decompression.

MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Status post decompression of a large dorsal epidural
hematoma, there is soft tissue swelling which continues to
impress the distal cord and proximal cauda equina.

CXR [**2133-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pacing leads in the expected position of the right ventricle.
No evidence of pneumothorax. 2. Massive enlargement of the left
atrium

Echo [**2133-6-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal functioning mitral valve prosthesis. Mild
aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Severe biatrial
enlargement. Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.

PM Interrogation [**2133-6-24**]:
PM functioning properly


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo Cantonese F with history of Atrial fibrillation, Mitral
valve replacement presented with epidural hematoma and lower
extremity weakness. Patient is s/p epidural hematoma evacuation
on [**2133-6-12**] and s/p single wire pacer placement on [**2133-6-14**]
sceondary to periop brady/pause. Patient was found to have
NSVT/?junctional tachycardia likely secondary to digoxin
toxicity.
.
The patient p/w spontaneous epidural hematoma and LE weakness on
[**2133-6-12**]. Following diagnositic evaluation, the patient was taken
to surgery for a T12-L2 laminectomy and subsequent evacuation of
the hematoma. At the time of admission the patient's INR was 3.5
as she was taking 3.5mg coumadin PO Qhs for prophylactic
anticoagulation due to her h/o afib and MVR. Her coumadin was
held and her INR monitored following surgery. She was placed on
coumadin 3.0mg Qhs once her INR dropped below 2.0 and she was
bridged with a heparin drip. Coumadin was increased to 4.0mg on
[**2133-6-17**] and as her INR rose to 2.8 on [**6-22**], decreased to 3.0mg.
Subsequent to her INR dropping from 2.5 to 2.1 on [**6-25**] and then
to 1.9 on [**6-26**] the coumadin dose was increased to 4.0mg and
5.0mg repectively. Coumadin continued to be titrated to a dose
of 3.5mg (her dose PTA) giving an INR of 2.4 at discharge.

In the perioperative period the patient began having episodes of
bradycardia and pauses for which a single wire pacemaker was
placed on [**2133-6-14**], with confirmation of proper lead placement by
CXR. The PM was interrogated on [**2133-6-24**] and found to be
functioning properly. Additionally in this time she developed
mild anemia likely due to the spontaneous hematoma and surgical
blood loss for which she received a total of 2 units of PRBCs
and has since resolved.

During this time the patient was continued on Lanoxin for her
atrial fibrillation and developed a NSVT/? junctional
tachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity. Her digoxin was
discontinued and per EP's recommendations was not restarted and
will be held indefinitely. In order to maintain K levels above
4.0 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia,
spironolactone 25mg PO daily was started. On this regimen the
patient required 40mEq of KCl PO daily to maintain her K levels
and this was reduced to 20mEq daily as the K level on the day
prior to discharge was 4.5. On discharge the K level was 4.3.

For heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to an
eventual dose of 75mg PO BID the day prior to discharge, during
which time the patient's BP was stable at SBP=110s to 130s. On
the day of discharge metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] was increased to Toprol
XL 200mg to help control SBP that were in the upper 120s.

Following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developed
right LE pain, which was attributed to a radiculpathy and was
successfully treated with Neurontin 100mg TID. Due to
predominately left LE weakness, PT was consulted and recommended
that the pt be discharged to an extended care factility where
she could receive further care from PT. The patient continued to
improve during the course of her stay, but was it was still
considered necessary that the pt receive rehab upon d/c. Prior
to discharge the patient was prescribed an AFO left foot splint.

In addition she spiked a temperature to 100.3, for which an
infection work-up was began. Urine Cx showed Proteus Mirabilis,
Bld Cx negative. She was treated impirically on Vacnomycin,
which was d/c after the Bld Cx came back negative, and
Ciprofloxacin. P. mirabilis was found to be intermediately
sensitive to ciprofloxacin and Tx was switched to a sensitive
antibiotic, Ceftriaxone 500mg po Q12H for 10 days. Ceftriaxone
was stopped on [**2133-6-29**] and the patient remained afebrile and
asymptomatic. Both incisions healed well without current
drainage, erythema, edema, or tenderness.

Lastly during her hospital course she developed some bladder
irritation/spasms and hematuria likely due to foley catheter
trauma. The catheter was d/c'ed and she was treated with Detrol
for a couple of days.  She has since been asymmptomatic and
without hematuria.
