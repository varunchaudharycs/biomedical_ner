Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2200-2-17**]:
FINDINGS: The study is compared with the initial NECT of [**2-14**]
and the
interval unenhanced and enhanced MR examinations of [**2200-2-15**].
Over the three-day interval, there has been little change in the
overall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantly
hyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axial
space of the left parietovertex. This appears to "mold" to the
contour of the subjacent convexity, where there is focal
low-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter,
corresponding to the FLAIR-signal abnormality in this region,
which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion,
gliosis, or both. The overall appearance is most suggestive of a
partially calcified en plaque meningioma, though there is no
specific evidence of "reactive change" in the suprajacent inner
table of the skull. There has been no other short-interval
change.

IMPRESSION: No short-interval change in the overall appearance,
with the
lobulated, predominantly hyperdense, process, in the extra-axial
space at the left parietovertex, given its stability and MR
[**Date Range **] more likely an en plaque meningioma, partially
calcified, accounting for the MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

Moreover, the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced
MR study
raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of
the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus, without
definite thrombosis, and possible venous obstruction-related
edema in local white matter. If this will affect therapeutic
decision, dedicated MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] venography might be considered.


MRI Brain [**2200-2-15**]:
FINDINGS:
The study is significantly limited due to patient motion
artifacts. There is enhancement noted in the area of known
hemorrhage in the left parieto-
occipital region, compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on
the prior
study. However, the etiology of enhancement is not clear as
there is
significant amount of hemorrhage in this location, as seen on
the prior CT and MR studies. Mildly dilated ventricles are
visualized, not adequately assessed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Study significantly limited due to motion artifacts.
Enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region, partly
extending along the dura, the
etiology of which is uncertain, as this is in the region of the
known
hemorrhage. Repeat evaluation, after resolution of the
hemorrhage can be
considered, to evaluate for any underlying vascular or
space-occupying lesion. Close followup with CT scan can also be
considered as clinically indicated.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2200-2-14**] to the neurosurgery service
after a mental status change at the nursing home. He was
admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan. However, the
patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a
meningioma. There was no hemorrhage there. The patient was
transferred out of the ICU on [**2200-2-18**].
He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist. PT
felt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing home
on [**2200-2-19**]. On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and
pureed solids without difficulty.

He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary
retention. A Coud?????? catheter was placed that night and he was
discharged with it in place. Flomax was started as well and
bladder training was begun. He may be able to have it removed in
a day or so at the nursing home. The patient should follow up
with a urologist.

The patient was made DNR/DNI in the hospital by his health care
proxy as well as for the ambulance ride. Palliative care and
medical consults were obtained to assist in management of the
patient. His medications were optimized due to his mental status
changes. Additionally a family meeting with all 3 teams
occurred. It was felt that surgery would not benefit the patient
and that quality of life was important. We all agreed that being
at the nursing home with his wife would be the best for him at
this time. The nursing home staff may want to consider a "Do not
hospitalize" policy with this patient and his health care proxy.
