History of Present Illness:
ONCO-MED HOSPITALIST ADMISSION NOTE
.
61 year old gentleman with COPD, stage IV NSCLC mucinous
adenocarcinoma and recent PE who presents with dyspnea. He
reports sudden-onset worsening of respiratory status on the
morning of admission without associated productive cough,
fevers/chills, CP, or other symptoms.
.
Of note, patient was recently readmitted in early [**2173-10-28**]
for SOB/dyspnea, at which time a new LLL consolidation was seen.
 He was provided with one dose of Vanc/Cefepime, and started on
a morphine drip in concert with patient's HCP as well as patient
wishes. Improvement in clinical status was noted overnight and
his morphine drip was discontinued.  His acute respiratory
decompensation was attributed to a mucus plug, aspiration,
perhaps with contributing atalectasis. He was continued
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, as well as enoxaparin [**Hospital1 **] for
his recent PE's.  Antibiotics were not resumed at time of
discharge. After discharge, blood cultures from [**2173-11-3**] grew
Fusobacterium Nucleatum in one out of two bottles.  The patient
was contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**2173-11-6**] regarding this lab result, and did not
feel any different since discharge from the hospital.  Repeat
blood cultures at his outpatient oncologist failed to reveal
positive cultures.  Since his recent discharge, discussion
regarding hospice care has been continued with his oncologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45322**], given the patient's poor prognosis.
.
In the ED, initial vitals recorded were a RR of 32. Labs showed
hyponatremia with a sodium of 129, otherwise unremarkable CMP.
CBC with WBC count of 16.0 with 97.3 PMN's and 2.4 %
lymphocytes.  HCT of 30.6, platelets of 508. Coags showed INR of
1.2, PTT of 31.8. CXR showed Stable right-sided pleural effusion
and post-obstructive consolidation, increasing left pleural
effusion with basal atelectasis. Patient had his pleurex
catheter drained with 300 cc's of straw colored fluid aspirated.
 He was administered albuterol/ipratropium nebs,
vancomycin/zosyn, as well as lorazepam and methylprednisolone.
.
In MICU, VS: 96.9 103 131/74 14 90%4L NC. He endorsed feeling
hungry. His respiratory status stabilized after clearing mucous
plug, but still requiring 4-5L NRB. No antibiotics were given as
low suspicion for acute infection. He improved with time,
albuterol/ipratropium nebs. He was continued on lovenox for
recent PE. In addition, as a large component of dyspnea was
anxiety, patient was placed on standing clonazepam 1mg TID.
Palliative care was consulted for assistance with pain control
and was made DNR/DNI. Of note, he was found to be growing G+
cocci in 1 of 2 Bcx bottles, was started on IV vancomycin and
was transferred out of ICU.
.
ROS: He denies F/C/S, N/V, headache, dizziness, chest pain,
abdominal pain, back pain, constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia,
urinary symptoms, or rash.  All other ROS were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo man with metastatic NSCLC to ribs, malignant effusion, and
encasement of right hilum, on enoxaparin for PE, Pleurex
catheter for malignant effusion, hx of CVA admitted to the ICU
for acute dyspnea.  He initially required non-rebreather O2m byt
after expectorating a mucous plug, his O2 requirement decreased
to 5L.  Palliative care consulted.  Clonazepam added for
anxiety.  Code status changed to DNR/DNI.  Blood cultures grew
GPC in clusters and GPC in chains, two separate species.
Started on vancomycin.  He continued to decline requiring more
oxygen again despite suctioning.  He was placed on a morphine
gtt for comfort and died [**2173-11-18**] at 16:20PM.
.
# Dyspnea/hypoxia: Due to malignancy and malignant effusion +/-
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Required non-rebreather in ICU, but
improved after mucous plug expectorated.  Blood cultures growing
GPC in clusters and GPCs in chains.  Started vancomycin [**2173-11-16**]
for GPC bacteremia, leukocytosis, increased mucous production,
leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea --> sepsis.  Continued
albuterol prn, fluticasone-salmeterol.  Tiotropium changed to
ipratropium nebs.  Continued guaifenesin/codeine and benzonatate
for cough.  O2 support as needed.  Morphine for dyspnea.
Lorazepam for respiratory distress.  Suctioned for worsening
hypoxia, but no improvement.  Trigger for hypoxia 88% on 6L
[**2173-11-18**].  Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his girlfriend agreed to comfort care
