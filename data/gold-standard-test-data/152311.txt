Imaging:
[**1-3**] CXR:
There is increased hazy vasculature bilaterally with bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right that have increased.
Compared to the prior study, there is dense retrocardiac
opacification consistent with volume loss/effusion/infiltrate.
Compared to the prior study, the amount of pulmonary edema has
increased. An underlying infectious infiltrate particularly on
the left cannot be totally excluded.

[**12-28**] Scrotal U/S:
Significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling with no
hypervascularity and no gas within the tissues identified. This
edema may be due to third spacing but ultrasound is unable to
further characterize. A clinical evaluation is recommended to
exclude a subcutaneous infectious
process, and if further imaging is required, a CT could be
performed.

2) No evidence of an intratesticular mass. No evidence of
epididymitis or
orchitis.

**FINAL REPORT [**2101-1-3**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2101-1-3**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2101-1-4**] 6:32 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-PICC 2 OF 2.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):


Brief Hospital Course:
An 89 year old gentleman with systolic CHF, chronic foley who
presented from rehab with Psuedomonal/E. Coli urosepsis.

#) Urosepsis:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
management of urosepsis.  While there he was maintained on
neosynephrine for 2 days.  He was started on Vancomycin & Zosyn.
 The patient was called out to the floor on Zosyn & Tobramycin.
Further microbiologic data suggested a treatment change to
Tobramycin & Ceftazidime to be continued until [**2101-1-12**].
Throughout this admission the patient's chronic foley due to
bladder diverticulum remained in place and regularly irrigated.

-Ceftazidime 2g IV Q12h last dose [**2101-1-12**]
-Tobramycin 100mg IV Q24, decrease dose to 80mg on [**2101-1-9**] to
finish course on [**2101-1-12**].
-Foley requires hand irrigation q4-6 hours, no continuous
bladder irrigation.

#) Atrial Fibrillation:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation for which he is on chronic anti-coagulation and
metoprolol.  Due to his poor PO intake and self-sustained rate
control, the patient will not be continued on metoprolol.  His
coumadin was held for much of his admission given a
supratherapeutic INR.  He will be discharged on 2mg daily with
PT levels to be followed twice weekly, goal [**12-21**].

#) Chronic DVTs: Anticoagulated as above.

#) Malnutrition/Wound Care (Sacral Decubitus & leg ulcers):  The
patient is tolerating limited PO with siginificant aspiration
risk & aspiration events.  Other feeding options were discussed
with the family but they have opted to maintain oral feeding.
Of note, the patient has a low Albumin in the 1s with
significant wound care issues as well as significant scrotal
edema.  The patient was admitted on Zinc, Vitamin C, & Vitamin B
but due to his poor ability to consume pills these medicines
have not been continued.

#) Leukocytosis: The patient has had a maintained elevated white
blood cell count while admitted. This is likely due to his
ongoing Pseudomonal UTI/chronic foley.  An assay for C. diff was
sent off and the results will be called to the accepting
facility.
- If C. Diff positive, will begin Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 at the
discretion of the family.

#) CHF: The patient has a history of Congestive Heart failure.
Given his renal failure and hypotension his lasix was initially
held. Given his tenuous renal failure we have not restarted
Lasix on discharge.

#) Pain: The patient was maintained on a fentanyl patch and with
tylenol and morphine IV.  On discharge he will be transitioned
to sublingual or liquid morphine for pain control.

# ARF: The patient has persistent renal failure with baseline
creatinine 0.8, 1. on discharge. All medicines were renally
dosed.

# Hypertension:  The patient's beta blocker and ace inhibitor
were not continued.

# Type 2 Diabetes:  The patient was continued on an insulin
sliding scale but did not require insulin.  We recommend
reducing his finger sticks to once daily only.

# Anemia: The patient had fluctuating blood volume without clear
blood loss other than phlebotomy.  He was not transfused on this
admission.

# L heel stage II pressure ulcer: Wound care as above.

# Dementia:  The patient has chronic dementia.  He was unable to
reliably take food by mouth, however in accordance with the
family wishes he was fed but kept on aspiration precautions.
