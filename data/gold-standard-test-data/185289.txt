Brief Hospital Course:
64yo M with HIV, HBV, HCV, HCC, cirrhosis status post orthotopic
liver [**Year (4 digits) **] ([**6-4**]), a history of DVT/PE and
nephrolithiasis, who was admitted on [**5-28**] for antibiotic
treatment of a VRE UTI and bridge from coumadin to heparin for
lithotripsy procedure [**6-1**].  His post-operative course was
complicated by fevers, confusion, unstable vitals consistent
with urosepsis/shock, requiring transfer to the  MICU and broad
antibiotic therapy, now transferred back to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**]
service, stable, and ready for discharge.
.
# UTI/Urosepsis/Urolithiasis: On admission, an oupatient culture
was reported as growing Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus.
Treatment of a VRE UTI infection with daptomycin was initated on
[**5-28**], with a documented negative urine culture on [**5-31**].    On [**6-1**]
patient underwent lithotripsy and placement of a stent.  During
the middle of the night, he was noted to have altered mental
status.  He had taken off his heparin gtt and was walking around
saying that he was ready to go home.  They continued to hold his
heparin gtt at that time.  He was placed back in bed, and noted
to be febrile with a Tm of 102.7 at 0030 this morning.  His BP
was 80/d at the time, HR in the 50s.  He received 1L bolus
without effect in his BP.  At 530 this morning, his BP was 104/d
and HR 88.  After the 1L of IVFs, his O2 sat was noted to be 87%
on RA.  He was placed on 2L NC and improved.  He received a
second L bolus and at 8 am this morning, was rigoring again with
T 102.6, BP 110/50, P 100, R 36 and 97% on 2L.  The MICU was
called for transfer. A urine culture drawn at this time grew out
polymicrobial (klebsiella, enterobacter, nonpsuedomonas
nonfermenter) and the patient was appropriately started on
meropenem on [**6-4**].   Urology confirmed placement and draining of
stent on [**6-4**].  A larger foley was placed to aid in the drainage
of the stones.  On [**6-7**] the patient had a PICC line placed for
outpatient antibiotic administration.  On [**6-7**], per ID
recommendations relating to culture sensitivies, the meropenem
was switched to Cipro.  The patient completed his course of
daptomycin on [**6-12**].  The patient will continue PO Cipro until
[**6-15**].  He will follow up with the [**Hospital 159**] clinic as an
outpatient.  He will follow up with ID as an outpatient.
.
Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:
The patient was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia thought to
be secondary to an aspiration. Other etiologies considered were
hypoxia secondary to volume overload from IV fluid boluses (last
echo in [**2132**] was normal) and pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage for
hospital acquired pneumonia with meropenem was started on [**6-2**]
and vancomycin was added on [**6-3**] to provide better coverage for
MRSA.  CXR on [**6-3**] showed a stable left lower lobe consolidation
with new opacity and air bronchograms in the right middle lobe
that could possible be atelectasis.  Respiratory aspirate
cultures  were without growth.  On transfer to the floors, the
patient was continued on meropenem for possible hospital
acquired pneumonia.  Vancomycin was stopped as per ID's
recommendations.  Antibiotics were continued as discussed above.
.
History of DVT/PE:
The patient had a PE in [**2132**] and was placed on heparin. On
arrival to the hospital, a heparin bridge was initiated to
prepare for the lithotripsy procedure.  On [**6-1**] the heparin was
held, the patient underwent the lithotripsy, and the heparin gtt
was restarted after the procedure.  The heparin was held during
the events leading up the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the MICU,
resulting in subtherapeutic PTTs.  He was restarted on heparin
in the MICU and bridged to coumadin.  On transfer to the floors,
his INR was supratherapeutic, requiring adjustment of the
coumadin to 5mg.  When the patient was transitioned to cipro,
his coumadin was empirically lowered to 3mg.  His INR trended
downwards and his coumadin was increased to 5mg.  He will have
his INR checked with this labs on Monday [**6-14**] and reviewed at
his clinic appointment on [**6-16**].
.
S/P OLT:
The patient has a hx of hepatitis B, HCC, and is s/p OLT one
year prior to presentation.  On admission he had stable LFTs and
no signs of encephalopathy on tacrolimus, cellcept, and bactrim
prophyllaxis.  Following his lithotripsy, the patient developed
with abdominal distension concerning for ascites, confirmed by
ultrasound, along with positive asterixis.  In combination with
his altered mental status, this was concerning for hepatic
encephalopathy.  On [**6-2**] the patient was started on lactulose for
treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, then transitioned to
rifaxamin on [**6-4**].  The patient was continued on his tacrolimus
and cellcept.  He will follow up in [**Month/Day (4) **] clinic, where he
will be assessed for future liver biopsy.  He will require an
INPATIENT stay for this biopsy so that he can bridged from
coumadin to heparin prior to the procedure.
.
Pancytopenia:
Patient has a longstanding history of pancytopenia.  WBC was 1.9
on admission and ranged from 1.5-3.1 over his hospital course.
HCT was in the low 20s and required 1 transfusion of pRBCs. This
is of uncertain origin, likely multifactorial [**12-29**] infection,
medication (HIV, antibiotics, etc). In setting of increasing
splenomegaly, we have considered a hem/onc process.  As per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], this is already being worked up in the outpatient
setting.
.
HIV:
Stable, CD4 65, VL 120, immunosuppressed on anti-rejection
medications.  No modifications were made to his HAART regimen
(RiTONAvir, Raltegravir) and bactrim ppx. Lyrica (for HIV
neuropathy) was held while in MICU, but restarted on the floors.
.
DM:
Stable, continue insulin sliding scale.
.
Depression:
Continued mirtazapine and lexapro.
.
BPH:
Continue terazosin.
