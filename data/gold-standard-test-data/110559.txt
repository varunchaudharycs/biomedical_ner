Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
For full H&P please refer to Nightfloat admission note briefly
this is a 58 y.o. Female with a history of gastric bypass 4
years ago w/ multiple recent complications including spinal
abscess, osteomyelitis, intraabdominal leak, spinal
osteomyelitis with abscess, sepsis who was initially admitted
for weakness.
.
On review of her initial note it appears she was discharged
following the aforementioned complicated course on a course of
first Clindamycin x [**1-28**] wks which was changed to Levaquin and
Vancomycin. On the day of her admission she was found by her [**Month/Day (3) 269**]
to be extremely weak specifically with lower extremity weakness
but no bladder/bowel incontinence or anaesthesia. She initially
was seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as pt
did not want further care at [**Hospital1 112**].
.
She was then admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where she was noted to
have hypokalemia due to increased K+ wasting though it is
unclear as to why this was occuring. She was also noted to be in
[**Last Name (un) **] thought to be secondary to Vancomycin toxicity (her reported
Vancomycin was noted to be 80?). An MRI was obtained given her
lower extremity weakness and was notable for worsening L4-5
disco-osteomyelitis. Orthopaedics were consulted and pt
underwent a diskectomy, debridement and anterior fusion on
[**10-20**]. Following induction of her anaesthesia she was noted to
be tachycardic ranging from 80s-110s. She underwent a 1.5 hour
surgery which was uneventful. In the PACU though her BP was
noted to drop from 110s to 70s, though she was mentating well.
BP was not fluid responsive and pt was started on Neo ar 0.3 and
titrated up to a max of 0.8. Following IVF resuscitation 2.8L as
well as 1u PRBC post-op (she received 2u PRBC prior to surgery)
she was able to wean off pressors and have an increase in her
urine output. For work-up of her hypotension she underwent [**Last Name (un) **]
stim testing which was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
.
Her ICU course has also been notable for a diffuse morbilliform
rash with palm and sole sparing. Dermatology were consulted for
possible SJS. Given lack of mucosal involvement SJS was ruled
out however Dermatology is still following the patient. The
rash, which has steadily been improving, was thought to be due
to Lamotrigine toxicity given her progressively poor Creatinine
Clearance. Though interestingly enough unclear if Lamotrigine
has dose adjustments based on renal clearance.
.
With regards to her diskitis, her blood cultures have thus far
been negative and she is currently on Aztreonam and Vancomycin
per ID recs. She is still being followed by Ortho who will take
her to the OR tomorrow for posterior fusion, after which she
will be able to participate in PT.
.
She is also being followed by Renal for her [**Last Name (un) **] which is thought
to be AIN [**12-29**] Vancomycin toxicity. Renal are currently
considering possible biopsy to confirm AIN.
.
On review of her vitals in the unit over the past few hours her
Tmax has been 100.2, Tc 98.6, HRs 109-118, SBP 114-149/59-70, RR
24, 100% on RA.
.
ROS per HPI.

IMAGING STUDIES:
CXR ([**2178-10-14**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Renal US ([**2178-10-15**]): Unremarkable renal son[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **]
hydronephrosis.
.
CXR ([**2178-10-15**]):
1. Right PICC catheter terminates at the junction of right
subclavian and right internal jugular vein, without evidence of
pneumothorax.
2. New-onset small right pleural effusion.
.
MR spine ([**2178-10-15**]):
1. Signal changes at L4-5 which has progressed since [**2178-9-17**]
and is concerning for disco-osteomyelitis. No definite epidural
extension is identified, although the lack of intravenous
contrast does decrease sensitivity. Endplate degenerative
changes are also a differential consideration (type 1), but
considered less likely given the progression.
2. Transitional anatomy with sacralization of the L5 vertebral
body.
3. Mild degenerative disc disease at other levels as detailed
above, most significant at the T7-8 level, where there is mild
spinal canal narrowing and indentation of the ventral aspect of
the spinal cord.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2178-10-16**]):
1. Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous and oral
contrast.
2. Free intra-abdominal air within the upper abdomen is somewhat
less in amount compared to the outside hospital CT exam from
[**2178-9-18**]. Evidence of extensive inflammatory changes in the
upper abdomen, not well assessed on this non-contrast
examination. No definte intra-abdominal collection..
3. Mesenteric adenopathy.
4. Left adrenal myelolipoma, stable.
5. Erosive changes involving the endplates of the L5 vertebral
body and S1 portion of the sacrum concerning for osteomyelitis,
better delineated on the recent MRI of the lumbar spine. No
other erosive changes evident throughout the visualized
skeleton.
6. Right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.
.
Lumbar Spine Xray ([**2178-10-20**]):
Single intraoperative cross-table lateral image of the LS spine
shows placement of a metallic interbody fusion device at L4-5.
Normal vertebral body alignment and discs. We have no
preoperative comparison radiographs.
.
CXR ([**2178-10-21**]):
Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Previous mild vascular
engorgement has resolved and may reflect hypovolemia. Heart size
top normal, unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Right-sided central venous line tip projects over the mid SVC.

[**2178-10-30**]: EGD
Impression: The stomach remnant appeared normal
Erythema in the lower third of the esophagus
Large small bowel ulcer which could represent the site of
bleeding (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:
Return patient to floor.
Continue high dose ppi.
Await biopsy report
Post discharge, patient needs outpatient GI follow up in fellow
clinic

[**2178-10-30**] Colonoscopy:
Impression:
Stool in the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] noted.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to hepatic flexure of [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. No
obvious bleeding source was noted.
Recommendations:
Return patient to floor
Since the colonoscopy was aborted at the level of hepatic
flexure, patient will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 58 y.o. Female s/p distant gastric bypass
complicated by recent hospitalization for leak s/p repair,
sepsis initially admitted for LE weakness, hospitalization c/b
diskitis s/p anterior fusion/debridement, ICU stay for
hypotension on pressors now transferred to floor awaiting
posterior fusion.

PLAN:

## Diskitis: Pt was initially admitted for lower extremity
weakness with mild weakness with the hip flexors, normal rectal
tone. MRI work up was notable for L4-L5 disco-osteomyelitis.
Unclear as to the source of her disco-osteomyelitis though given
her recent discharge for sepsis it is possible that she seeded
when she was bacteremic. Pt underwent debridement under OR and
anterior fusion and later posterior fusion. Anterior fusion
post-op course complicated by sepsis (discussed below). OR Swabs
and multiple subsequent bld cultures have been negative.
- Continued on Aztreonam and Vancoymcin per ID recs, switched
from aztreonam to levofloxacin. Now on Levofloxacin PO Q24H, and
vancomycin 1gm IV Q24H
- post-op pain control: PCA switched to morphine contin 15mg PO
Q12H, plus morphine 5-15mg PO Q6H PRN breakthrough pain (has had
little pain med requirements, pain well controlled)
- Ortho recommended PT
- [**Name (NI) **] need a vanc trough drawn on [**2178-11-4**] and dose adjustement
accordingly

##. Rash: Pt noted to have diffuse rash over entire body with
sparing of mucousal membranes, feet soles and palm. Dermatology
followed and concluded this was due to lamictal, secondary to
increased levels during ARF. Pt now noted to have lamictal
allergy.
-Held lamictal and rash resolved without signs of mucositis
-Pt to continue triamcinolone cream for a total of 2 weeks
(start date [**2178-10-23**])

## Sepsis: Pt admitted to the unit for sepsis. Although resolved
it is unclear as to the exact cause. Pt's hypotensive episode
occured several hours after anterior fusion surgery so unlikely
to be anaesthesia induced. Given requirement of pressors
following surgery in an area complicated by infection
hypotensive episode may be [**12-29**] transient bacteremia. Vanc and
levo broadened to vanc and aztreonam. After several days,
aztreonam switched back to levofloxacin. Bld cultures and swabs
have thus far been negative. Sepsis resolved after less than 24
hours and pt has been off pressors since.
- was continued on Aztreonam and Vancomycin per ID recs and
later switched back to levofloxacin
- To rehab facility: Pt has a f/u appointment at the [**Hospital **] clinic
of [**Hospital6 1708**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD on
[**2178-11-5**] 1000am. #: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39041**]. They will decide the stop date
of patient's antibiotics.
.
## ARF: Unclear etiology. Creatinine peaked to 2.8 but
eventually resolved now at 0.9. Per renal, ARF may have been due
to vancomycin toxicity from too high dosing. (vanc level 80 at
one point). No signs of uremia and no dialysis was employed.
- To rehab facility: Please make sure to f/u vanc troughs every
three days, as pt has unstable vancomycin pharmacokinetics

## Guiac positive stool: Pt with guiac positive melena. Hct and
hemodynamics remained stable. Pt underwent EGD which showed a
large jejunal ulcer with stigmata of bleeding but no active
bleeding. This may have been due to the stress from all the
acute illnesses of osteo/discitis, sepsis, etc. No intervention
done. Colonoscopy non-diagnostic due to poor prep. Hct stable.
Pt continued on pantoprazole IV Q12H until GI follow determines
when to discontinue.

## Malnutrition: Pt malnourished with an albumin of 1.9 and INR
of 1.4 secondary to vitamin K deficiency thought to be related
to her severe illnesses during the last 2 months. Pt refusing
TPN initially, calorie count initiated, only 200-300 calories
per day, therefore, TPN initiated inhouse started [**2178-11-2**].
Patient also with K and Mg abnormalities.
- To rehab facility: Please see Page 2 for nutrition recs.
- To rehab facility: Please check daily K and Mg and replete
lytes as necessary.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for weakness. You had gastric
bypass 4 years ago and a recent revision in [**2178-5-27**] that was
complicated by intra-abdominal leakage and spinal abscess with
osteomyelitis. During your hospital stay your surgery to debride
the osteomyelitis was complicated by sepsis, which promptly
resolved after IV fluids and IV antibiotics. You also developed
kidney failure, possibly due to vancomycin toxicity (high serum
levels at presentation) which also resolved over time. You
developed a rash thought to be related to a lamictal allergy in
the setting of increased reduced lamictal clearance given kidney
failure. This too resolved with time. Also, you developed an
ulcer which bled, and a scope showed that this ulcer remained
stable. You will follow up with GI regarding the ulcer here at
[**Hospital1 18**] and you will return to the [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Hospital1 112**], where they
know you quite well. You also developed malnutrition secondary
to all of these illnesses, which is requiring total parenteral
nutrition.

Please make sure to follow up with all your follow up
appointments.

Followup Instructions:
You have an appointment at the [**Hospital **] clinic of [**Hospital6 13185**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD already an appointment on
