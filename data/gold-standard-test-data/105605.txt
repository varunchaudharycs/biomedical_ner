History of Present Illness:
77-year-old male with history gastric CA metastatic and atrial
fibrillation, who developed acute onset aphasia, eye movement
abnormalities and left-sided hemiplegia during an
ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on [**2199-8-30**] for malignant pleural
effusion. Patient had been off of coumadin for 10 days for the
thoracentesis. Code stroke was called and patient was
transferred to the ED. A CTA revealed a large thrombus in tip of
the basilar artery, not extending into PCA's. He was taken
emergently to angio, where embolectomy and intrarterial tPA
injection was performed. Ischemia time was 4 hours; EBL was
minimal, and he received 2U plts for plt count of 25. Patient
was transferred to the SICU for postop care.

Chest X-ray [**2199-9-8**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-9**] through
[**9-3**]:

Moderate left pleural effusion is reaccumulating relative to
[**9-1**].  There is no pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion
including a fissural
component is chronic. No pulmonary edema. Heart size is top
normal. Right
infusion port catheter ends in the mid SVC. Presence of small
pulmonary
nodules would be obscured by the extensive overlying pleural
abnormalities.

[**2199-9-6**] Liver/ Gallbladder US:
1. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, though with common bile
duct within normal limits in size. MRCP could be performed to
assess for relationship of hepatic metastases to intrahepatic
ducts if intervention is planned.

2. Multiple known hepatic metastasis is incompletely evaluated
on this study.

3. Layering sludge within the gallbladder.

4. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.

[**2199-9-6**]: Right Femoral US:
Pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery. Size has
slightly increased from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane
only.

[**2199-9-2**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Right nephrostomy tube in stable position. Similar extent of
mild left
hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Retained contrast within the
left kidney,
likely from recent CT two days prior, is compatible with
obstructive
nephropathy.
3. Similar extent of bilateral pleural effusions with associated
compressive atelectasis and right middle lobe collapse.
4. Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with unchanged omental and
hepatic
metastases.
5. Increased anasarca, pulmonary edema, and size of abdominal
ascites,
suggestive of volume overload.

[**2199-8-31**]: ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.

IMPRESSION: No left ventricular thrombus seen. Normal global
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**2199-8-30**] MRI HEAD:
MPRESSION: Multiple small acute infarcts are identified in both
parietooccipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres without
definite acute
infarct within the brainstem. Small vessel disease and brain
atrophy.

[**2199-8-30**]: CT Head and Neck:
1. Thrombosis of the basilar artery. Possible perfusion defects
concerning
for infarct within the brainstem; however, CT perfusion is
suboptimal for the evaluation of the posterior circulation. MRI
could be performed for further evaluation.

2. Extensive focal atherosclerosis with marked narrowing of the
left
subclavian artery just proximal to the takeoff of the left
vertebral artery.  No other areas of significant stenosis or
aneurysm formation are seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Basilar stroke: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-8-30**]
for acute stroke. He was treated with MERCI and intra-arterial
TPA: The patient's neuro status was closely monitored. He was
transitioned from a heparin gtt to lovenox given recent embolic
stroke and hypercoaguable state in setting of malignancy.  The
patient was cleared for a regular diet after a speech and
swallow evaluation.

#. Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm: Patient s/p
mechanical and chemical thrombectomy via right common femoral
artery puncture, and was found to have small right common
femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. He had a repeat ultrasound on
[**2199-9-6**] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increased
in size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only. Vascular
surgery was following, and did not feel there was a need for
intervention.  The patient's HCT remained stable.

#. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (malignant).
CXR on [**2199-9-3**] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern in
right lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stable
right pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lung
likely representing increased atelectasis and increased pleural
effusion. The patient's supplemental O2 was gradually weaned as
tolerated.  Repeat CXR on [**2199-9-8**] showed increased pleural
effusion and patient had a repeat thoracentesis on [**2199-9-11**] prior
to discharge. A post-procedure chest x-ray was done and there
were no complications from the procedure.

#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient has h/o bilateral hydronephrosis, likely
secondary to obstructive uropathy. s/p right nephrostomy tube in
08/[**2198**]. Prior to this admission, the patient had been scheduled
for bilateraly stent placement on [**2199-9-12**]. His left stent showed
hematuria and had poor output in setting of creatinine increase
from 1.3->1.7, his left nephrostomy tube was placed. On
discharge, his creatinine was 2.0. This lab test should be
repeated.

#. Stage IV gastric CA: Patient recently diagnosed with gastric
cancer, and gastric biopsy returned positive for poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating through the deep
mucosal layer. Cytology from the peripancreatic lymph nodes was
also
positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.
Patient started first cycle of chemotherapy with epirubicin,
oxaliplatin and capecitabine on [**2199-8-22**]. Given recent
complications in course, chemo currently on hold.  His cell
counts were monitored closely in setting of recent chemo.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient rate-controlled with metoprolol.
Coumadin had been held initially for thoracentesis, and was not
restarted in setting of stroke and low platelet count. Patient
was previously on argatroban gtt, but placed on heparin gtt
after rise in platelets and exclusion of HIT. Patient will need
long-term anticoagulation in setting of recent embolic stroke
and hypercoagulable state.  He was started on lovenox.

#. Hypertension: BP was well-controlled after transfer to
medical oncology service. The patient was continued on
metoprolol for both rate control and BP control.

Metastatic Gastric Cancer w/ obstruction of left ureter
Atrial Fibrillation


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure being involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname **].

1. Stroke: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of your
acute stoke. You had a procedure to remove a clot from a major
artery in your brain. This helped to prevent your stroke from
causing more damage to your brain. You were also treated with
blood thinners to prevent more clots from forming.

2. Cancer: You have been diagnosed with metastatic gastric
cancer. You were not given any cancer treatments during this
admission. You should follow-up with your oncologist as an
outpatient as to when you should restart chemotherapy.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: You have atrial fibrillation, which is
an abnormal heart rhythm. The fast rate was controlled with
metoprolol, a drug that slows your heart rate down.

4. Pleural effusion: You had a thoracentesis (Draining of fluid
from around the lung) on two occasions during your hospital
course.

5: The following changes were made to your medications:
-ADDED Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous injection twice a day
-STOPPED Lisinopril, Coumadin, Digoxin, Vicodin
-ADDED Senna, Docusate, Miralax
-ADDED Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID (three times per day)
