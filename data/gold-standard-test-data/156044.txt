139 on [**2141-10-13**] to 126 on [**2141-10-21**]. Her trileptal was tapered and

116.
.
Her Urine Sodium was 48, her serum Osm was 248 and her Urine Osm
was in the 432 consistent with SIADH. We also felt that she was
slightly hypovolemic. Hence she was treated with hypertonic
saline with a goal of increasing her Na ~ 8MeQ/24 hours. She
also received NS for volume repletion. Her trileptal was tapered
off by the  Neurology sevice and transitioned over to keppra for
antiseizure prophylaxis. Also, her HCTZ was discontinued and her
BP remained in the 120s-130s in the ICU. Her Na gradually
improved to 134 by the morning of [**2141-10-26**].  The pt. remained
stable while in the ICU, showing no evidence of seizure
activity, and her mental status gradually improving.  Per
request of the Neurology service she underwent an [**Date Range **] that on
prelim read showed slowing in the region of your old stroke -

discharge.  On HD 3 the pt. Na had reached a normal level, she
