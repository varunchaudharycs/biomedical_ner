Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, chills, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 43-year-old woman with a pmhx. of recurrent ovarian
carcinoma (s/p TAH-BSO, IV and intraperitoneal chemotherapy,
radiation, and microperforation of simoid colon requiring
sigmoid resection with end-colostomy) who presents from home
with fevers, chills, and nausea of one day.

Patient recently began ixabepilone chemotherapy on [**2193-5-2**] and since that time reports increased vaginal discharge,
which she describes as "yellow and brown debris."  States that
she has been using about 2 pads per day, soaking through each,
and that discharge is "liquidy" in character.  This is an
entirely new symptom for her.  Also about one week ago patient
noticed that her stoma "looked different."  It seemed retracted
into her abdominal wall, and there was increased "light pink
bubbles" at the opening.  She went to see her ostomy nurse on
day prior to admission who told her to come into the hospital if
she developed fevers, chills, or increased abdominal pain.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 45419**] woke up with these symptoms on day of admission and
came to the ED.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient had a CT which showed a small rectal stump
leak, locule of air near staple line of [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch, and a
colovaginal fistula, which had likely been developing over the
course of weeks (and was not likely the cause of her current
symptoms).  Surgery was consulted and they felt that given the
contained leak and proximity of likely residual tumor, there
were no good (or safe) surgical options.  It was recommended
that patient be treated with antibiotic coverage and remain NPO
for the time being.

In the ED initial vitals were: 100 136 134/77 20 100. Patient
was given vancomycin 1g, cefepime and metronidazole 500mg.  Mag
was noted to be 1.2 and patient given 2g.  Na was 128 (131 on
repeat) and k was 5.6 (4.2 on repeat).  WBC 23.  Also given 6L
of fluid.  Patient remained tachy into the 130, SBP 97-120.  A
U/A revealed trace modertate blood, trace leuks and glucosuria.
Zofran and tylenol were given symptomatically.  On transfer, BP
was 125/80, HR 120, and she was satting 99%RA.

ROS:  Chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain in LLQ.  Negative
for headache, trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, chest
pain, palpitations, dysuria, or any other concerning signs or
symptoms.

Radiology:
[**5-22**] CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: (pt reports hx of
allergy to contrast)
1. Interval increase of left pelvic mass with close association
with the
bowel.
2. Enterovaginal fistula.
3. Locules of gas near the staple line of the Hartmann's pouch;
it is unclear if it is intra- or extra-luminal, infectious
process at this site not excluded. No evidence of parastomal
collection.
4. Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
5. Bilateral hydronephrosis, stable from previous study.
6. Hepatic hypodensity, concerning for metastasis.

[**5-26**] KUB FINDINGS: Gas and stool are seen throughout the colon
to the region of the splenic flexure. Gas is seen in some mildly
dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 4 cm, without
air-fluid level. This likely represents an ileus.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo femaled with advanced ovarian cancer, was admitted with
complaints of fever, chills, and was found to have SIRS/septic
shock, and was initially managed in the ICU.  She was started on
empiric coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She was found
to be bacteremic with strep anginosus, which is likely d/t
intrabdominal fisulization/abscesses. A CT of her abdomen and
pelvis (without contrast due to allergy) showed significantly
worsening ovarian cancer, colovaginal fistulization, and
possible microperforation vs infection at her [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch.
She clinically stabilized, however further discussion with her
oncologist and surgeon revealed that there are no further
therapeutic options to offer, and she is not a candidate for
surgery. Her primary oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She
was transitioned to DNR/DNI, and she elected to go home with
hospice care.

Her blood cultures later revealed strep anginosus (milleri), and
her antibiotics were changed to oral flagyl and levofloxacin, as
she prefered an oral regimen for palliation.  At the time of
discharge, she was still having low-grade temps, but seh was not
symptomatic from them.  She will complete a 2 week course of
antibiotics on [**2193-6-5**].
.
* Colovaginal fistula - She has a known colovaginal fistula,
however there are no surgical options per GynOnc discussion.  It
does appear that her vaginal discharge may be improving slightly
with antibiotic treatment.
.
* LLE Edema - She was noted to have some left sided edema
(LLE/LUE). THere was intially concern for possible DVT, however
LENI;s were negative.  The edema is most likely related to =
tumor blocking lymphatic drainage. Elevation and LLE compression
hose were recommended for comfort.
.
* Ovarian cancer - Per primary oncologist, pt has no further
chemotherapy options. Transitioned to DNR/DNI and palliative
care consulted and assisted throughout the hospitalization.
-- Patient is being discharged to home with hospice
.
* DM -
Pt had several episodes of hypoglycemia on lantus due to
decreasing oral intake. Her lantus dose was serially
downtitrated. Tight glucose control not necessary at this time,
but would like to avoid extreme highs that may produce symptoms.

- Pt discharged on reduced lantus dose without sliding scale.
.
* Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
.
* Hyperlipdemia - Hold statin and Tricor
.
* Ostomy Retraction - Ostomy is retracted as per ostomy nurse
and surgery consult. Now with resuming stool output. KUB showed
some stool c/w constipation. She was treated with Miralax with
some improvement in her stool output.  She was recommened to
continue to take stool softeners and  Miralax and to stay well
hydrated to prevent constipation in the future.  She may also
use milk of magnesia as well as needed.
.
PPX: Pt is at high risk for DVT given ovarian cancer. Pt will be
discharged on daily dosing of lovenox to prevent DVT for
palliative benefit
[**Date Range **]: home today with hospice.  She is DNR/DNI.  Her oncologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be the contact person for the Hospice
agency.
