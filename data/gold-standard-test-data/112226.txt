Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of HTN, afib, ? PE, multiinfarct dementia
and recurrent UTI who presents with lethargy, hypoxia, and LE
erythema. Pt is aphasic at baseline. Per notes from ED and PCP
coverage, the patient was being treated for recurrent UTI with a
course of levofloxacin started on [**6-7**] but was otherwise doing
well. Last night she was noted to be more lethargic than normal
with increasing SOB. She was noted to be hypoxic with O2 Sats of
80% so was transferred to the ED.

In the ED she had a fever to 101.8 with intermittent hypoxia
that improved to 98% with 4LNS oxygen . She was given
Clindamycin 600mg IV x1 for LE cellulitis and a dose of
Levofloxacin 500mg IV for possible UTI. For her hypoxia, she was
given 20mg IV Lasix and a combivent neb with significant
improvement with CTA neg for PE and LENI neg for DVT. She
continued to have intermittent hypoxia of unclear etiology so
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
.
In the MICU, the patient was treated with CTX and Vanc for
UTI/cellulitis. Also diuresed. Patient improved and sent to
floor [**6-11**] on 2L NC. Patient noted to have increased Eos in
blood and urine so CTX stopped and placed on levo/macrodantin.
.
[**6-13**] Patient decompenstated on the floor. Patient desatted to
80's on 6L NC. ABG 7.46/52/63 on 6L NC. Patient initially with
HR in 80's. Patient given lasix 20mg IV x 1 and an alb neb. Then
went into afib with RVR into the 140's maintaining her pressure.
Patient given 5mg IV lopressor x 3 with out response in HR.
Transferred back unit for further mgt of HR and hypoxia, where
she was started on a diltiazem drip; CTA was without evidence of
PE. Course complicated by persistent hypotension requiring
multiple fluid boluses; this resolved after the discontinuation
of the diltiazem drip. She was started on an amiodarone load
with conversion into NSR. Her O2 sat improved with diuresis. A
picc line was placed and she was started on aztreonam (instead
of macrobid) for UTI. She was transferred back to the general
medical floor on [**2175-6-16**]. Currently, she has a new rash over her
trunk and arms bilaterally--thought to be from Ceftriaxone.

Pertinent Results:
[**2175-6-10**] CT CHEST: 1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism,
aortic aneurysm, or dissection.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
3. Midthoracic vertebral body compression fracture likely
chronic.
4. Calcified left lung granuloma and mediastinal lymph node
consistent with old granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis.
5. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
.
[**2175-6-10**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2175-6-10**] CT HEAD: Slightly limited study by patient motion, but
no intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
.
[**2175-6-10**] CXR:  No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
.
[**2175-6-10**] ECG: Technically difficult study
Sinus tachycardia
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Early R wave progression
Lateral ST-T changes are probably due to ventricular hypertrophy

Clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**2175-6-13**] CTA CHEST: 1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Right lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with tiny
bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Moderate hiatal hernia.
4. Unchanged calcified mediastinal lymph node.
.
[**2175-6-13**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions without overt
CHF/pulmonary edema and no evidence for new pneumonia. Calcified
granuloma and node on left. Osteoporosis of spine with
compression fractures.
.
[**2175-6-13**] ECG: Sinus rhythm @ 78 with atrial premature beats. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Since the previous tracing of [**2175-6-10**]
probably no significant change, although baseline artifact on
both tracings makes comparison difficult. TRACING #1
.
[**2175-6-13**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Since the previous tracing  of [**2175-6-13**] atrial
fibrillation and ST-T wave changes are present. TRACING #2
.
[**2175-6-14**] FLUORO: Successful repositioning of the right-sided PICC
which now terminates in the distal SVC. Line is ready for use.
.
[**2175-6-14**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is  16-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF 70-80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle
.
[**2175-6-16**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved, borderline interstitial
edema decreased, heart size normal, but left atrium likely
enlarged. Stable pulmonary vascular congestion. Small right
pleural effusion may also have decreased. Leftward tracheal
deviation just above the thoracic inlet is due to tortuous head
and neck vessels.

CT Head
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Ventricular prominence is unchanged, consistent with moderate
cortical atrophy. Focal hypodensities in the left parietal lobe,
coronal radiata, and frontal lobe are unchanged, representing
chronic infarction. More diffuse hypodensities in the
periventricular white matter are unchanged, and most consistent
with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Surrounding osseous
and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2175-6-10**]. Unchanged
appearance of several left-sided chronic infarcts, and small
vessel ischemic disease. No intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR [**6-19**]: IMPRESSION: Slight interval improvement in pulmonary
vascular congestion, otherwise no significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of HTN, afib, PE, multinfarct dementia
admitted with UTI, left leg cellulitis, and diastolic CHF;
course c/b AF with RVR.
.
#Diastolic CHF: initially due to infection, worsened by AF with
RVR and fluid resuscitation, was continued on Lasix with good
diuresis.  Needs serial assesments of volume status/weights at
her nursing home with her lasix titrated accordingly.
Low dose ACE was added.  No evidence of ACS.  Lasix held on day
of d/c secondary to bump in Cr (.8-->1.3).  Needs serial Chem 7
at her nursing home.  Currently has minimal oxygen requirements.
.
#AF: Now in NSR on amiodarone and Lopressor 12.5 TID.  Needs one
more week of Amio 200 [**Hospital1 **] then 200 mg daily.  Poor
anticoagulation candidate given fall risk and advanced age.
.
#UTI: Pt has received 7 days of treatment (CTX, macrodantin,
aztreonam) for E. coli UTI; d/c'd aztreonam/ctx given rash.
.
#LLE Cellulitis: resolved with 10 days of vancomycin.
.
#Rash: suspect secondary to ceftriaxone or aztreonam. Resolving.
.
#Dementia:  pt noted to be more somnolent on [**6-19**]; CT
head/ABG/toxic-metabolic w/u unrevealing.  ?secondary to
benadryl (from rash) along with neurontin.  Would avoid sedating
meds until MS completely back to baseline.  No evidence of
recurrent infection.
