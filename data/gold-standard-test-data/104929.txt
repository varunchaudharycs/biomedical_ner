History of Present Illness:
52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation
and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of
breath over past 2 weeks. On [**5-23**], patient awoke with 10/10
pleuritic pain radiating down to left shoulder to left arm
associated with SOB and diaphoresis.  She went to PCP who
ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CTA which was negative for PE and diagnosed her with
pleurisy. She was prescribed motrin 800mg TID.
.
Her pain was mildy improved with the motrin but she developed
DOE which progressed to dyspnea at rest over the past 2 weeks.
Also endorsing chest heaviness, pleuritis left sided/LUQ pain,
orthopnea and PND. Her pain would be releived sitting forward.
Denies LE edema. 1 week ago she experienced 1 day of vomiting x5
episodes NBNB. In the past few days had fevers/chills and abd
distention associated with constipation and low grade headache.
TMax of 101.3. Also had dry cough. Saw PCP who took CXR which
showed pna with b/l pleural effusions.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 101 HR 120 BP 120/77 RR 18 Pox
89% RA. Resp distress. CXR L>R effusion and pericardial
effusion. Triggered in the ED for hypoxia to 89% RA, placed on
O2 by N/C + abx(CTX and lev), 2L bolus, followed by 150/hr.
Cards c/s: resolving pericardial effusion, decided not to tap.
Labs notable for ALT: 146 AP: 483 Tbili: 2.4 Alb: 3.3 WBC to 17
(no bands). Believe that pleural effusion may be bigger issue.
Had thoracentesis in ED 1200cc straw colored fluid. Prior to
transfer, 99.4, 110, 122/85, 20, 100% by N/C 5L.
.
Upon arriving to the ICU, patient was in [**10-31**] left sided
pleuritic chest pain. She felt SOB slightly improved. Pain worse
and different after thoracentesis. Also endorsed "contact"
dermatitis with couple blisters on lower extremities worse 2
weeks ago thought to be a nickel allergy. She has been drinking
POs well recently but appetite poor. Endorsed 1 year of
nightsweats which she believes are postmenopausal. Of note, she
missed her [**2173**] mammogram.

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ([**2174-6-6**])
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion (1.3 cm
anteriorly and 1.8 cm around the right atrium). The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief right atrial
diastolic invagination. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-3-9**],
the pericardial effusion is new. No overt tamponade is seen
however elevated intrapericardial pressure is suggested.
.
Echo: [**6-14**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The small pericardial effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements and appears
largely organized with minimal free fluid. The pericardium may
be thickened.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**6-8**]/201, the
pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation
and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of
breath and DOE over past 2 weeks admitted to the MICU with
pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion in the setting of
presumed viral pleurisy and pericarditis that developed into an
effusion after chronic NSAID use possible aspiration/CAP PNA who
developed AFIB with RVR secondary to pain and pericardial
effusion, transaminitis with cholestasis and acute renal failure
in the setting of anemia and NSAID use who has a persistent O2
requirement with pleuritic pain and resolving pericardial
effusion.  She improved clinically prior to discharge after CT
placement for her L effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her R
sided pleural effusion.
.
# SOB/CP/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with most obvious
etiologies being pleural, pericardial effusions, and . PE was
less likely given [**5-23**] CTA negative. Due to her effusions, it was
thought she may have an underlying PNA and she was started on
levaquin for CAP.  She was given a prolonged course due to
concern that she may have had infection in her pericardial
fluid.  The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for
hemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for
potential procedure for a possible pericardial window.  From a
respiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation
which was done under rapid sequence given signs of early
tamponade.  She was extubated without event when it was
determined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusion
needed to be drained.  Instead, cardiology recommended serial
Echo's to follow the effusions size.  An echo on [**6-14**] showed
that the effusion was reduced in size compared to prior imaging.
.
#Afib with RVR: The Patient has a history of lone atrial
fibrillation. On day of admission patient went to Afib to 200s
briefly sustaining in the 160s.  This was thought [**2-23**] to pain
and infection vs tamponade physiology.  She received metroprolol
IV and dilt drip. When patient was intubated, she converted back
to sinus rhythm and maintained in sinus rhythm.  After
extubation and while on the floor the patient did not have any
palpitations or further episodes of Afib wtih RVR.
- She will need to discuss with her outpatient physician
[**Name9 (PRE) **] with aspirin when her pericardial effusion
resolves.
.
# Pleural Effusions: She presented with pleuritic chest pain
which was initially attributed to her pleural effusions.
Initially, the DDx was broad including infectious(Lyme/parvo
negative, [**Location (un) **] pending), malignant(cytology ultimately
negative), and rheumatologic([**Doctor First Name **] negative and C3/C4 normal). CHF
and cirrhosis unlikely based on H+P. Lipase normal makes
pancreatits unlikely. Thoracentesis reveals exudate, likely
parapneumonic given fevers, and a viral pleuritis was also
considered.  ID was consulted who recommended empiric coverage
for CAP with a prolonged course of Levofloxacin (14 days -
finish on [**6-20**]) due to a concern that the pericardial fluid
could [**Hospital1 **] infection.  Cytology negative, cultures negative.
Morphine and fentanyl pleuritic CP. The most likely diagnosis
was a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial process
possibly in the setting of aspiration 1 week prior.  Of note her
effusions persisted despite antibiotic therapy and NSAID
therapy.  She was given diuretics with lasix which did not
reduced the size of her effusion.  Therefore, a L sided chest
tube placement by IP in addition to a right sided thoracentesis.
 After subsequent removal of her bilateral pleural effusions,
her symptoms of SOB and O2 requirement resolved.
.
# Pericardial Effusion: Initially echo concerning for early but
not overt tamponade physiology and exam was concerning. Patient
was given IVF to maintain preload. Serologies were sent as
above. Her pulsus was monitored closely and was never above
12mmHG. Cardiology consult followed closely and serial echos
showed improvement in effusions. The decision was made not to
drain effusions for diagnostic purposes given the risks
involved.  She was restarted on NSAID therapy for viral
pericarditis.  Of note, her effusion improved by echo prior to
discharge.
.
# CAP:  Given her exudative effusion and viral pleuritis there
was concern for CAP and possible aspiration.  She was given a
two week course of levofloxacin to finish on the date listed
above.
.
# Diarrhea:  She had transient episode of diarrhea while on
antibiotics, and her diarrhea resolved.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/Low UO: Dark urine and poor output early in ICU course.
Thought potentially from NSAIDs. Renal spun urine and it was not
active.  She had low UOP, which improved with IVF.
.
Cholestasis and Hepatitis:  She was noted to have to have
abnormal LFT's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic R
sided abdominal pain.  There was concern that she could have
either a viral induced hepatitis with cholestasis versus a
congestive hepatopathy in the setting of mild volume overload.
Cholecystitis was less likely given the absence of a white
count.  Her LFT's trended down independent of diuresis thereby
suggesting/confirming a possible viral etiology for her
hepatitis and cholestasis.  Of note her hepatitis serologies
were negative.
.
# Anemia: Baseline hct 40s most recently in [**2171**]. No signs or
symptoms of bleeding. Likely from systemic process going on.
Normal colonoscopy in [**2171**]. Of note, she is currently
menopausal, and has iron studies that suggest she has anemia of
chronic disease, or at least anemia with acute inflammation.
- She will need a CBC as an outpatient.
