RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2170-3-7**] 2:28 AM
Reason: please eval for infiltrate
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
30F with esophageal stricture s/p esophagogastrectomy, worsening
saturation and ventilation
INDICATION: Esophageal stricture status post
esophagogastrectomy.
COMPARISON: Radiograph dated [**2170-3-5**].
AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lines and tubes are unchanged.
There are low lung volumes. Pleural-based right apical opacity
is unchanged. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the study
of 2 days prior with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and
right apical pleural- based density.
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2170-2-28**] 8:16 AM
Reason: PT WITH [**Name (NI) 39043**], ? BILIARY OBSTRUCTION & SIGNS OF
SHOCK LIVER
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
30F s/p ex lap x 2, with gross cirrhosis, who is now developing
hyperbili.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for biliary obstruction & signs of shock liver.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
INDICATION: Cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia.
FINDINGS: A bedside portable examination was performed. The
study is markedly limited due to body habitus.
Portal vein is patent, but demonstrates reversal of flow, new
since [**2168-10-11**], probably related to underlying cirrhosi. No
gross intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Spleen is slightly enlarged, measuring 12.1 cm in length.
Limited examination of the kidneys shows no frank evidence of
hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) Limited examination, showing reversal of portal
venous blood flow, new since [**2168-10-11**].
2) No gross evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent esophagogastectomy with rou-en-y
reconstruction for longstangind history of esophageal stricture
and gastric atony on [**2170-2-22**].  Overnight patient develop increase
in need for fluid to support blood pressure as well as a bile
leak from one of the anastomosis.  Then patient developed
increased in abdominal bladder pressure.  She was taken urgently
to the operating room for the revision of the anastomosis and
wash out.  Her abdomin was unable to be closed so bogata bag was
placed.  After the operation, patient continued to require fluid
and pressors for blood pressure support.  Then patient became
septic.  She was started on Xigris for treatment of septic
shock.  She improved but continued to require full ICU care.
Neurologically, she moved all extremities but required sedation
and paralysis to help with oxygenation.  Cadiovascularlly, she
was started on Xigris which initally helped with decreased in
need for pressors but she continued to need pressors for blood
pressure support.  She also developed atrial fibrillation which
lead to need for amiodarone drip for a period of time.  She
continued to need mechanical support and the need for supported
increased for both oxygenation and ventilation over time.
Patient also developed renal insuffiency.  Patient also
developed shocked liver with coagulation parameters not
responding to replacements.  On [**2170-3-5**], she developed
leukocytosis to 40s and she was taken to the operating room for
a washout.  Subsequently she developed multi-organ failure.
After a discussion with family patient was made comfort measures
only and she died after withdrawing her ventilation.
