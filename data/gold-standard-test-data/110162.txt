Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT head
MRI/MRA
LP
Larynoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is an 88 year old female, resident at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 553**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 554**] [**Hospital3 **], with medical history pertinent for
Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, and recent cornea transplant who
now presents with altered mental status.
Per last progress note from patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has been
in her usual state of health with exception of management of a
cervical vertebral fracture secondary to fall as well as plans
for a repat penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) s/p
failed prior. The patient was at that time apparently at her
baseline and cleared for surgery. The patient underwent
penetrating keratoplasty on [**2119-3-30**] for indication of failed
graft without complication. The patient was seen by her
ophthalmologist on [**2119-4-4**] with impression that there was
moderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but no
discharge to suggest infection. Polysporin was discontinued
(with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter)
and other meds (Pred 1% TID OS, Timolol 0.5% [**Hospital1 **] OU, Xalatan QHS
OS, Tobradex
[**Doctor Last Name **] OS QHS) continued.
The patient now presents form her [**Hospital3 **] with concern
for altered mental status. Only limited information is available
from available staff at [**Hospital3 400**], with report only that
patient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and "not making
sense". Per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patient
was in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning,
looking well. Later in the day, the patient was reported to be
walking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. The
patient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet.
Recommendation was made that patient be sent to hospital for
further evaluation. Per discussion with daughter, the patient
has had prior episodes of confusion in setting of underlying
infetion, usually UTI.
.
ED Course: 98.4 -> 102.8 rectal, 186/84, 85, 20, 93% RA. Labs
notable for WBC 8.0, lactate 1.8. Not signed out, but per
nursing report and discussion a central line was attempted given
poor PIV access for which the patient received Haldol. No
documentation of dose is available, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN to RN signout this
was 5mg IV. Central line was not successfully placed and
ultimately a 22 PIV in the hand was obtained.
The patient had a negative UA, CXR without obvious infiltrate
although limited. Ophthalmology was not contact[**Name (NI) **] as [**Name (NI) **]
impression was that eye was not infected. LP was recommended by
ED but patients' daughter declined this. The patient was given
Azithromycin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone empirically and is now
admitted to the medical service for ongoing care.
On arrival to floor patient is lethargic but wakes to voice. She
answers questions although requires repeat questioning at times
to wake her. Patient reports mild neck pain since having collar
removed, denies headache, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain or
other localizing symptoms.

CT head [**4-5**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
2. Diffuse cerebral atrophy with moderate sulcal and ventricular
prominence.
3. Chronic microvascular infarcts, unchanged.
4. Paranasal sinus disease as described, likely acute in the
sphenoid sinus.

CT neck [**4-6**]:
1. Significant swelling/inflammation of the soft tissues at the
base of tongue, oropharynx, with fullness in the vallecula and
the piriform sinuses, overall resulting in moderate to marked
narrowing of the oropharynx. The etiology of this finding is
uncertain from the present study. To correlate with direct ENT
examination.
2. Fullness of the hypopharynx and adjacent portions of
esophagus - no adequately assessed on the present study- further
evaluation recommended.
3. Increased attenuation of the fat in the carotid space, with
soft tissue attenuation opacity, with heterogeneous appearance,
causing indentation on the right internal jugular vein extending
down along the carotid space, into the region of the thoracic
inlet. This may relate to inflammation, phlegmon, and
radiation-related changes if there is history of radiation in
the past and less likely neoplastic. Close followup evaluation,
with ultrasound can be considered to evaluate for any abscess,
given the patient's symptoms of fever.

CT orbits:
1. Increased attenuation of the preseptal soft tissues with some
enhancement, on the left side, likely due to inflamamtion/
post-surgical changes- correlate with clinical examination. No
definite abscess on the present set of images. No intraconal
abnormality. F/u as clinically indicated.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease

CT head [**4-9**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Persistent cerebral atrophy.
3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
4. Paranasal sinus disease.

MRI/MRA brain:
Final Report
HISTORY: Parkinson's, delirium, lethargy, right facial droop and
dysarthria.
Evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke.

Comparison is made to most recent head CT of [**2119-4-9**]

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were
obtained through
the brain without intravenous gadolinium. 3D time-of-flight MR
arteriography
was also performed. Volume-rendering reconstructed images were
evaluated.

MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of
intracranial
hemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or regions of restricted
diffusion to suggest
acute infarction. A few scattered periventricular T2/FLAIR
hyperintensities
are noted, which are nonspecific but likely suggest chronic
small vessel
ischemia. There are also adjacent prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **]
spaces. While
there is underlying global cerebral atrophy, the degree of
dilatation of the
ventricular system may be somewhat disproportionate to the
amount of central
atrophy. Small amount of fluid is noted in the mastoids
bilateral.

MR arteriography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] displays no aneurysmal
dilatation.
Mild atherosclerosis is noted in the right M1 segment. Posterior
circulation
is left dominant.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction. Scattered changes likely
related to
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

2. Question slightly disproportionate degree of ventricular
dilatation in
relation to the amount underlying cerebral atrophy. While this
finding is
nonspecific, in the appropriate clinical scenario it may reflect
underlying
NPH.



Brief Hospital Course:
This pt is a 88yo female w h/o Parkinson's disease, mild
dementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospital
for AMS and to the ICU for airway narrowing.
.
# Airway narrowing: She was noted to have swelling of the tongue
and lower lips on admission. A CT of the Head and Neck with IV
contrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ?
of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. Over course
of day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds with
good O2 sat of 97% on 2L which has been stable. ENT was
consulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling in
oropharynx with patent airway. Swelling around false cords,
tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. The team thought
the swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction to
medications. She was started on solumedrol 60IV and famotidine
20mg. She was given one dose of zosyn and then switched to
unasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. Pt without
leukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ED but afebrile since), or
abcess. ENT and anesthesia recommended transfer to ICU for
further monitoring. She was monitored and continued on Decadron
for three doses. During successive scopes by ENT, oropharyngeal
edema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent.
Unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectious
process vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious and
lower airway appears more edematous and less infectious.
Lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visibly
improved by the time she was called out to the floor.
-Pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection and
switched to Augmentin for additional 5 days at dc
-ENT follow up appt was set up

# s/p corneal TP: lid edema on exam. Ophtho believes likely
secondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due to
allergy.  Ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommended
decreasing doses of eye drops.
-FU appt with Optho set up
.
#. Altered Mental Status: On admission, she was lethargic,
possibly from the Haldol she received in the ED. By the time she
was called out of the ICU, she was likely at her baseline mental
status, pleasant and easily conversant. Shortely thereafter,
however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mg
Haldol and later the same day 5mg of Zyprexa. She remained
agitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic and
barely arousable. Head CT was unchanged from before. She had not
had any new fevers or new signs of infection. She had a lumbar
puncture that was unremarkable. MRI/MRA was neg except for some
ventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which was
difficult to differentiate from NPH. Neurology thought it was
unlikely to be NPH. EEG showed some focal acitivity concerning
for sublinical seizures. Pt was started on keppra, initially
continued to have periods of somnolence along with R sided
facial droop (which was thought be Neurology to represent a
post-ictal state with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis) but day before discharge
had significant improvement in mental status and was alert and
conversive. Due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactive
delirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significant
improvement in level of alertness.
-Pt curently is on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and to be
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] later and kept at that dose.
-Pt should be followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
-Outpt FU w neurology is already set up
.

#. UTI: grew Enterococcus in UCx. She was continued on Unasyn
for 10 days.
.
#. Positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negative
Staph. This was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.

#. Parkinson's Disease: continued Sinemet except when patient
was too lethargic to safely take meds
.
#. Hypertension, benign: Lisinopril was stopped due to concern
of angioedema. Atenolol was continued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  TSH normal on [**2119-4-6**] so not a picture of
myxedema and cannot account for MS change. Continued
levothyroxine.

#. Diabetes II, diet controlled without complication:
- insulin sliding scale while inpatient  and bs were wnl. Pt can
have [**Hospital1 **] finger checks to Rehab but since not needing insulin,
does not have to be on sliding scale

# Deconditioning: per PT eval, pt was 2 person assist and will
need significant PT therapy to get back to baseline where she
was walking with a walker
