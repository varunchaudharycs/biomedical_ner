Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52-year old female with a history of metastatic
breast cancer, s/p lt. mastectomy now enrolled in clinical trial
"05-395" (lapatinib monotherapy 1500 mg), who noted lt. arm
swelling [**2-28**]. Doppler neg for clot, but CT (routine, restaging)
revealed pericardial effusion. Echo [**3-3**] revealed: small to
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion, most
prominently inferolateral to the left ventricle and around the
right atrium, but ~1cm anterior to the right ventricle. There is
mild right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent with
increased pericardial pressure/early tamponade physiology.
.
[**3-5**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2177-3-3**], the pericardial effusion appears similar to slightly
larger. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
[**3-7**]: There is subtle RV diastolic compression without collapse
(no overt tamponade). Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2177-3-5**], there is slightly less pericardial fluid
anteriorly. Otherwise no change.
.
A pericardial drain was placed with return of approximately 250
cc of serosanginous fluid and normalization of right heart
pressures. She is admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY: She was initially diagnosed in [**2164**] with a 3.5
cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma, lymph node positive, LVI
positive, ER positive. She is status post left mastectomy with
reconstruction, CAF followed by tamoxifen. She recurred in
[**7-/2169**], with metastasis to her left supraclavicular node and
lung. Biopsy documented HER-2/neu over expression by
immunohistochemistry. ER positive. She was treated with Arimidex
for six months, which was followed by Taxol and Herceptin. She
was then treated with high-dose chemo and Herceptin followed by
transplant as part of the clinical trial. This chemo included
thiotepa, [**Doctor Last Name **], and Taxol. In [**9-/2173**], she was treated with
letrozole and Herceptin and was then switched to Aromasin and
Herceptin in 11/[**2174**]. Upon progression [**Male First Name (un) **] was switched to the
lapatinib phase II trial in [**7-28**], and herceptin was
discontinued. She has received 8 cycles of lapatinib.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Metastatic breast cancer as above.
2. Autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2169**].
3. History of meningoceles.
4. Hyperlipidemia.


Social History:
A single parent. She lives with her 13-year-old daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

Family History:
Father has lymphoma.

Physical Exam:

pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of less than 6 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There
was no thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities,
scoliosis or kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and
there were no use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to
ascultation bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no
adventitial sounds or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, clicks or gallops.
There was a slight [**1-28**] HSM.

*** Not Signed Out ***

BRIEF HISTORY:
This 55 year old female with known diagnosis of metastatic
breast cancer
presented with pericardial effusion diagnosed on echocardiogram
with
significant respiratory mitral flow variation. Patient was
therefore
referred for pericardiocentesis.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Pericardial effusion.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Pericardiocentesis: was performed via the subxyphoid approach,
using an
18 gauge thin-wall needle, a guide wire, and a drainage
catheter.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and
RVEDP
was 12mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated

measuring 35/15mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were
equalized to
the right (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg). There was significant
respiratory variation of systemic arterial pressure up to
20mmHg. There
was equalization of RA and pericardial pressures.
2. Pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopy guidance.
Pericardial drain was subsequently placed with 240cc
serosanguinous
fluid removed. Repeat measurement of pericardial pressure and RA

pressure demonstrated clear seperation.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated right sided filling pressures with equlization of
RA/LA/pericardial pressures.
2. Successful placement of pericardial drain.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]
Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-7**],
there is now minimal residual pericardial effusion.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]  1:00:10 PM
Sinus rhythm
Normal ECG
Since previous tracing, no significant change
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-3-11**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest, small right pleural effusion is present.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is new since [**2-28**]. Consolidation
in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and a right
apical paramediastinal mass are unchanged. Left lung is clear.
Several loops of pericardiocentesis catheter projecting over the
subxiphoid midline, the base of the heart and superiorly to the
level of the pulmonary outflow tract, are acutely coiled and
should be evaluated clinically to see if they are draining
properly. No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-11**]
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion primarily inferolateral to
the left ventricle with minimal effusion anterior to the right
ventricle. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology
are seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-10**],
the  inferolateral effusion is more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with
pericardial effusion.
.
1. Pericardial effusion. Likely malignant. Pericardiocentesis
was performed with approximately 250 cc of serosanguinous fluid
output and normalization of right heart pressures. A pericardial
drain was placed with 320 cc of serosanguinous fluid output the
first 12 hours, then 75 cc over 6 hours, then no output. A
repeat echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion
without evidence of tamponade as above. The pericardial drain
was removed. An echocardiogram the next morning showed stable
small pericardial effusion. Cultures were negative at the time
of discharge and cytology was pending. The patient will have a
repeat echocardiogram five days after discharge and will
follow-up with her oncologist. The patient may need a
pericardial window or balloon pericardiotomy procedure if the
effusion increases in size.
.
2. Infectious disease. The patient had a temperature to 100.8
the second day of admission. The patient's only localizing
symptom was a nonproductive cough the patient has complained of
for the past three weeks, overall improved since that time.
Chest x-ray showed atelectasis but no new consolidations.
Urinalysis negative for infection. Urine, blood, and pericardial
fluid cultures without growth at the time of discharge. The
fever was likely secondary to atelectasis or the patient's
underlying malignancy.
.
3. Breast cancer. The patient is now off the lapatinib study.
The patient is followed by oncology.
.
4. Anemia. The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 31-36
during admission. The patient's iron studies showed an iron to
TIBC ratio of 5%, although ferritin was within normal limits.
Folate and B12 were within normal limits. Further management
deferred to the patient's primary physician.
