incision clean. (4)Scrotal edema
EXT: warm and well perfused, 2+ DP pulses palpable bilaterally
LYMPH: no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy
SKIN: no rashes, no jaundice .


Pertinent Results:
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2125-11-2**]:
CONCLUSION:
1. Relatively large rim-enhancing collection in the right thorax
wall
adjacent to the thoracotomy site.
2. No clear sign of ongoing leak.

CT Chest [**2125-11-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of periesophageal fluid following stent
placement.
Drains remain within the pleural space, with no interval
increase in
periesophageal fluid. No periesophageal abscess. Adjacent
compressive
atelectasis.
2. Interval near resolution of left pleural effusion.
3. Multifocal atelectasis.
4. Exam not optimized for assessment of tracheomalacia.
5. Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2125-12-6**]:
1. Slightly decreased intrathoracic fluid collection with
decreased passive
atelectasis.
2. Resolution of extrathoracic fluid collection.
3. No additional source found to explain the patient's spiking
fevers.
4. Endotracheal tube 3.5 cm above the carina. NG tube with the
distal tip in
a subdiaphragmatic position within the stomach. Jejunostomy tube
in the
appropriate place with contrast opacifying bowel distal to the
tip of this
tube.

Pathology [**2125-10-10**]:
1.  Lymph node, level 7 (A-B):Fragments of lymph node, no
carcinoma seen.
2.  Esophagus and stomach, esophagogastrectomy (C-X):Focal
intramucosal adenocarcinoma, See Synoptic Report.
3.  Gastric donut (Y):No carcinoma seen.
4.  Esophageal donut (Z):No carcinoma seen.
5.  Stomach, gastric fundus (AA):No carcinoma seen.

Echo [**2125-12-7**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Grossly preserved biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Limited study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old male admitted following successful
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy, Buttressing of intrathoracic
anastomosis with thymic fat pad Laparoscopic jejunostomy,
Therapeutic bronchoscopy, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  He was
transferred to the SICU intubated and sedated, NGT, right chest
tube, JP drain and Epidural for pain. He was extubated on POD1,
placed on 3L NC and humidified face tent with oxygen saturations
> 90%.  His oxygen requirement increased requiring aggressive
pulmonary toilet, nebs, and chest PT.  Initially he was
hypovolemic, fluid challenge was given with a good response.
Once his respiratory status improved he transferred to the floor
on [**2125-10-15**]. On POD 6 ([**10-16**]) barium swallow negative for leak
and diet advanced to clears which were well tolerated. On POD 8
([**10-18**]), pt experienced acute R sided CP and RUQ abd pain,
hypoxia, and diaphoresis. CXR demonstrated ptx. DART placed with
bilious drainage, EGD showed necrosis at anastomotic site. Pt
returned to OR for debridement gastric conduit and repair POD 9
([**10-19**]) and admitted to TSICU postoperatively with CTx3, JPx2. Pt
underwent EGD POD 14 ([**10-24**]) with healthy-appearing anastomosis.
On POD 19 ([**10-29**]) pt undersent percutaneous tracheostomy
placement. Pt noted to have persistent JP drainage. On POD 30
([**11-9**]), pt underwent esophageal stenting and NGT was
discontinued. JP output transiently decreased but subsequently
increased after stent placement. On POD 46 ([**11-25**]) pt underwent
EGD which demonstrated good stent position and endoscopically
placed NGT.  He continued to have respiratory distress requiring
mechanical ventilation, with tachypnea and agitation with any
withdrawal of sedation.  His hospital course remained stable
until [**2125-12-18**], requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation.
On [**2125-12-19**], the family requested no further interventions, and
that he be allowed to pass if he began to worsen.  On [**2125-12-21**],
with the family at bedside, his ventilation was turned off, and
he expired at 11:30am.
