Pathology: pending
CT chest:
FINDINGS: Bulky lymphadenopathy is present in the imaged portion
of the lower neck, superior mediastinum, throughout the
intrathoracic mediastinum, bilateral hila, and to a lesser
extent within the axillary regions. Large right pleural effusion
is dependent in location and measures simple fluid density. A
small amount of loculated fluid is also present within the major
fissure and in the anterolateral portion of the right lower
chest. Extensive consolidation is present within the right lower
and right middle lobes.  Peribronchiolar abnormalities are
present in both upper lobes with a combination of ground glass
and consolidation accompanied by bronchial wall thickening and
small peribronchial nodules. A dominant peribronchial nodule in
the left upper lobe measures 2.2 cm and is surrounded by a halo
of ground-glass opacity (26, series 3A). This corresponds to a
rapidly growing focal opacity on serial chest x-rays between
[**2135-2-8**] and [**2135-2-10**]. Additional
peribronchiolar abnormalities are present to a lesser extent
within the left lower lobe.

Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region,
but note is
made of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy as
well as
incompletely imaged splenomegaly.

Lucent spine lesions within the lower thoracic spine (image 53,
series 3A and image 48, series 3A) are probably hemangiomas.
Degenerative changes are also noted at multiple levels
throughout the spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal lung abnormalities most suggestive of a widespread
infectious process. Nodular opacity with ground-glass halo in
left upper lobe is nonspecific, but this appearance may be
associated with angioinvasive Aspergillus infection in the
setting of neutropenic fever.
2. Large simple right pleural effusion.
3. Extensive lymphadenopathy, likely related to the provided
history of CLL.  Splenomegaly is also in keeping with this
diagnosis.
4. Two lucent thoracic vertebral body lesions in the lower
thoracic spine
which probably reflect hemangiomas.
.
TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. No clinically significant valvular
regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. An area of echodensity measuring 7.4 cm x 4.9 cm
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) is seen that appears to be contained within a small
right pleural effusion. Clinical correlation and consideration
of a chest CT for further characterization suggested.
.
LENI:
FINDINGS: Color and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale son[**Name (NI) **] was performed on the
bilateral lower extremities. The bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal in
compressibility, augmentation, and Doppler waveforms. The calf
veins are patent and compressible. There is no deep vein
thrombosis in either lower extremity.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 83 year-old female with a history of CLL who presents
with respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory Distress. Etiology likely secondary to worsening
effusion as well as new infiltrates concerning for multifocal
pneumonia. Patient with known malignancy and therefore at risk
for hypercoagulable state. [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score appears to be low -1 (+1
for malignancy, -2 for other cause of dyspnea). LENIs negative.
Biomarkers flat. TTE with normal systolic and diastolic
function. Patient underwent uncomplicated thoracentitis on [**2-9**],
500cc was removed. Fluid largely transudative. Gram stain with
no growth. Cytology pending.  CXR with LUL infiltrate. Urine
legionella negative. Blood cx: NGTD. CT scan consistent with
multifocal pneumonia; though question of fungal per radiology,
clinical suspicion higher for pneumococcal pathogen. Patient
continued on Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin with plan for 8-10day
course. Patient's respiratory status improved on these
antibiotics and O2 was weaned as tolerated. At time of transfer
to floor on [**2-11**], oxygen saturation was >94% on 3L NC.  Narrowed
to Levofloxacin alone prior to discharge
.
PENDING CYTOLOGY NEEDS FOLLOW UP.  ALSO RECOMMEND CT CHEST AFTER
TREATMENT COMPLETED.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]. Patient with history of chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine 1.5. Creatinine on admission 2.7. Etiology
pre-renal, AIN in setting of recent bactrim usage. UA and urine
culture without sign of infection. Urine eosinophils negative.
FeNa: 1.3. Creatinine slowly improved with IVF and was 2.3. at
time of transfer to the medical floor. Trending daily.  It was
lowered to 1.7 prior to discharge.
.
# CLL. Patient diagnosed in [**2125**]. Patient last treated with
fludarabine in [**2133-5-29**]. Labs notable for elevated WBC >20 since
4/[**2134**]. Patient without anemia or thrombocytopenia. IgG levels
checked. IgG level wnl. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] followed patient closely. No
plan for IVIG infusion.
.
# Diabetes. Last HgA1c: 9.0. Patient states she does not take
any meds for diabetes and her daughter said she eats whatever
she wants. Monitoring QID FS, ISS.
.
# Hypothyroid. Continued Synthroid
.
# FEN: IVF, replete prn, diabetic/cardiac diet
