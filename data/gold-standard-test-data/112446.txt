SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

RESPIRATORY: The infant had respiratory distress syndrome on
admission to the NICU and was intubated and received surfactant
therapy x2. He remained ventilated with conventional ventilation
until [**2197-10-11**], which is day of life 25 when he required
high frequency ventilation at that time for sepsis issues.
Within 24 hours he returned to conventional ventilation. In the
setting of his chronic lung disease, he was started on Lasix on
DOL #42 ([**10-28**]), receiving Lasix every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday. He extubated to CPAP on [**2197-11-7**], day of life 52,
successfully weaned to nasal cannula on [**2197-11-27**],
which is day of life 73. He weaned to room air on [**2197-12-17**], and has remained stable on room air since that
time. He has had no apnea or bradycardia issues for well over
a week. He was given caffeine citrate from [**2197-11-19**],
through till [**2197-10-17**], at which time caffeine was
discontinued due to increased heart rate. Caffeine was never
restarted thereafter.

Currently, he is receiving Lasix every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.  He had been receiving KCl as well but this was
discontinued on [**12-20**] and his most recent Cl on [**12-26**] was 106
with a K of 5.5.  The infant will be followed for chronic
lung disease by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**] at [**Hospital3 1810**] and has
a follow- up appointment on [**1-5**].

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant presented with symptoms of PDA on
[**2197-9-17**], at which time indomethacin was given.  A
post-indomethacin echocardiogram on [**2197-9-19**] showed
that that the ductus was closed. Followup echocardiogram was done
on [**2197-10-3**], due to re-presentation, which showed a small
1 mm PDA. No indomethacin was given at that time. Two further
echocardiograms have been done, both in [**Month (only) 359**] (23 and 26th)
due to persistent murmurs. Both of those showed a very tiny PDA,
neither of which was treated with Indocin. The infant has
been hemodynamically stable and at this time does not have a
murmur and has normal heart rate and blood pressure. No
further issues.  He does not have a murmur at the time of
discharge.

The infant did present with a brief period of supraventricular
tachycardia on [**2197-10-17**], at which time caffeine citrate
was discontinued and no urther episodes have been observed.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: IV fluids were initiated
on admission to the NICU and changed to total parental nutrition
over the next few days. An umbilical arterial catheter was placed
and a double lumen umbilical venous line was also placed on
admission. The infant was started on enteral feedings on
[**2197-9-21**], with a slow feeding advance and achieved full
enteral feedings. A PICC line was placed on [**2197-9-23**].
The double lumen UVC was discontinued at that time. Enteral
feedings were advanced and the infant achieved full enteral
feedings by [**2197-9-30**]. Enteral feedings were then
further concentrated to caloric density of breast milk 30 calorie
per ounce with Beneprotein.

The infant had an episode of abdominal distention with an
abnormal KUB and was treated for 14 days for medical necrotizing
enterocolitis which was started on [**2197-10-10**]. The KUB
subsequently normalized and the infant was restarted on enteral
feedings on [**2197-10-27**]. Feedings advanced without an
incident.

Currently, he is feeding PO ad lib of 26 calorie breast milk
mixed as breast milk with 4 calories of Similac powder per ounce
and 2 calories of corn oil per ounce. The infant's most recent
weight is 2810 grams. He is gaining well. He is taking
approximately 3 ounces every 4 hours enterally. Most recent set
of electrolytes were done on [**2197-12-26**], and the results
are Na=138, K=5.5, Cl=106, HCO3=23. His most recent head
circumference is 34 cm, most recent length is 48 cm, both done on
[**2197-12-26**]; at present he is 10 to 25th percentile for
weight, 50 to 75th percentile for head circumference, and 25th to
50th percentile for length. He is on daily multivitamins, 1 ml
per day.

Renal: On [**2197-12-26**], renal ultrasound was performed
which showed bilateral calcifications in both kidneys, consistent
with chronic lasix use.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The infant did have a period of medical
necrotizing enterocolitis that was discussed under fluid,
electrolytes and nutrition as above, treatment from [**2197-10-10**], through [**2197-10-27**]. The infant did have
hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin level of 3.8/ 0.3
and did receive a total of 8 days of phototherapy.

HEMATOLOGY: The patient's blood type is A positive, DAT
negative. The infant has received numerous blood product
transfusions, and in total has received 5 transfusions of
packed red blood cells with the most recent transfusion being
on [**2197-10-28**]. The infant is on elemental iron, ferrous
sulfate at 0.5 ml PO daily. Most recent hematocrit was 36 on
[**2197-12-12**], with a reticulocyte count of 8.1%.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were screened on
admission to the NICU. The infant had a white blood cell
count of 5.1 with 29 polys, yielding an ANC of 1479. There
was no left shift. The infant received 48 hours of ampicillin
and gentamycin initially which were subsequently discontinued
when the blood culture remained negative at that time. The
infant had a sepsis evaluation done on [**2197-9-29**], at
13 days of life due to clinical instability. CBC at that time
was normal but the blood culture grew staph epidermidis
bacteremia. The infant was started on vancomycin and
gentamycin and given a 7-day course of antibiotics at that
time. At the end of that course of antibiotics, the infant
presented with medical necrotizing enterocolitis and that was
on [**2197-10-10**]. The antibiotic therapy was switched to
Zosyn to treat for medical necrotizing enterocolitis at that
time. The infant received 12 days of Zosyn therapy which was
changed on [**2197-10-21**], to vancomycin, gentamycin and
clindamycin when a blood culture grew positive at that time
for gram positive cocci. CBC at that time was not shifted on
[**2197-10-10**]. The infant received an additional 7 days of
antibiotics which were subsequently discontinued on [**2197-10-27**]. The infant had a yeast diaper rash and was treated
with miconazole powder from [**2197-10-21**], through till
[**2197-10-29**]. There have been no further infectious
disease issues.

NEUROLOGY: The infant has had numerous cranial ultrasounds
done on [**2197-9-18**], [**2197-9-25**], [**2197-10-16**], [**2197-12-21**], all within normal limits.

SENSORY: Hearing screen was performed and the infant passed
in both ears.

OPHTHALMOLOGY: The infant has had numerous ophthalmological
examinations. The initial examination was done on [**2197-10-30**], and the most recent ophthalmologic examination was
[**2197-10-26**]. The infant did have mild ROP but has
progressed to mature eyes on [**2197-10-26**], and the plan
is for follow up with ophthalmology in 9 months after
discharge.

family. If there are any concerns, she can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56048**].
