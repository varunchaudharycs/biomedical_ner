History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of atrial
fibrillation, systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease who
presents from NH with altered mental status.  Per report, pt was
noted by staff at NH yesterday to be difficult to arouse and
having labored breathing.  His vitals at the time included BP
112/57, and O2 sats and temperature were not obtainable due
likely to hypothermia.  He was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
revaluation.  Of note, per his daughter, he was recently
hospitalized ([**2015-7-16**]) from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with congestive
heart failure.  During this hospitalization he was noted to have
deteriorating mental status and delirium, which is why he had
been discharged to NH.
In the ED, VS T 92.1 axillary, BP 100/50, HR 50, RR 21 88% 6L
initially then placed 99% NRB.  He received vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  Also received
vitamin K IV 10 mg for coagulopathy with INR to 7.2.  With CT
head negative for acute intracranial process.  Also received 1 L
IVF total in ED.
On arrival to MICU, he was noteedd to be bradycardic to HRs to
30s and hypotensive to SBP 80s with MAPS 50s.  He was given 1 mg
atropine with HR to 50s.  He was given 500 cc fluid bolus x 2
and SBP came up to 90s.

Relevant Imaging:

CT Head
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures. Extensive
bilateral periventricular as well as subcortical white matter
hypoattenuation related to chronic
microangiopathic ischemic changes is evident.

The ventricles and sulci are moderately prominent, appropriate
for age-
associated involutionary changes. Bilateral basal ganglia
calcification and extensive calcification along the tentorium
and falx cerebri are evident. The osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable. A nonspecific focus of hyperdense
focus is noted in the left pre-zygomatic soft tissue. Clinical
correlation is advised.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. A small hyperdense
focus in the
left pre-zygomatic soft tissue could represent calcification and
clinical correlation is advised.

ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is dilated at the sinus level. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Aortic stenosis. Dilated
ascending aorta.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study to assess aortic
stenosis is suggested when the patient can be transported to the
Echo laboratory.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of systolic congestive heart
failure, atrial fibrillation, who presented with hypoxia,
hypotension, and hypothermia.

Upon admission to the MICU, agressive therapy was initiated
keeping a broad differential diagnosis. Patient however
continued to deteriorate and abruptly became profoundly
bradycardic, unresponsive to atropine or increasing doses of
pressors, culminating in asystole; patient was pronounced dead
at 1:05am on [**2105-7-28**]. Below are the details leading to these
events, arranged by problem:

1)Hypotension / Hypothermia: On initial presentation on the
floor SBP 80s, given 500cc fluid bolus x 2 with SBP to 90s.
Meets SIRS criteria with hypothermia and tachpnea and
hypotension concerning for sepsis, with pneumonia as the most
likely source.  Also on differential was hypovolemic hypotension
for occult blood loss, cardiogenic shock, adrenal insuffiency
and myxedema coma. Cooling blanket placed on patient upon
arrival.

Patient was given fluid boluses and central access was obtained.
Echocardiogram was obtained and revealed mildly depressed
ejection fraction (40%) with inferolateral wall hypokinesis and
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Central venous pressure was
measured and found to be elvated to 24mmHg, which even in the
setting of TR was felt to rule out hypovolemia. Patient was
initiated on Dopamine in hopes of supporting both blood pressure
and heart rate. Arterial line was placed for accurate assessment
of arterial pressure. Hematocrit remained stable and pressure
responded to pressor support.

Patient started on stress dose steroids for possible adrenal
insufficiency.

2)Hypoxia: With bilateral infiltrates and likely superimposed
fluid overlaod.  Given recent hospitalization and extent of O2
requirement, high suspicion for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia
(HAP) with vancomycin and zosyn. This was later changed to
Vancomycin and Cefepime. Patients blood gas was concerning for
hypercarbia, and after re-discussing goals of care with family
and confirming patient did not want to be intubated, non
invasive ventillation was initiated. Patient tolerated NIPPV
well and hypoxia / hypercarbia / respiratory acidosis improved
until his sudden decompensation.

3)Bradycardia: With baseline bradycardia per history, unclear
etiology.  On arrival to MICU, bradycardic to HR in 30s, gave 1
mg atropine with HR to 50s.  All nodal agents were stopped and
heart rate improved with Dopamine administration.

4)Meningitis: Given patients poor baseline mental status and
findings of significant nuchal rigidity, concern for meningitis
was raised. Given patients decompensated status, lumbar puncture
was not pursued and empiric coverage with Ampicillin for
listeria, Vancomycin/Cefepime for Staph/Strep were initiated.

5)Hypothyroidism: TSH of 20, difficult to interpret in this
setting as sick euthyroid may have impacted laboratory results.
Given decompensated state, endocrine consult was placed and
thyroid hormone was supplemented intravenously at higher doses
than per outpatient regimen. Free T3, T4 and Thyroid binding
protein were ordered but were not available before patient
decompensated. Per endocrine team recommendations, T3 was not
given due to concerns for arrythmia and cardiac side effects,
and given very poor level of evidence for its efficacy.

6)Coagulopathy: INR 7.2 on admission in setting of
anticoagulation.  Given vitamin K and FFP. DIC labs negative.

7)Chronic kidney disease: With known baseline CKD stage III,
likely exacerbated in the setting of hypotension.
