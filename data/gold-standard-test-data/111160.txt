Mechanical ventilation/ intubation x2


History of Present Illness:
EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE

Date: [**2141-7-3**]
Time: 04:13

The patient is a Pt is a 70F with PMH of HTN, PVD and [**Hospital **]
transferred from outside hospital with severe pancreatitis and
respiratory failure requiring intubation. History was obtained
from family and the medical record.

Two days prior to admission, pt began experiencing sharp RUQ
pain, nausea, nonbloody, nonbilious vomitus and diarrhea. The
family denies any fevers, cough or chills and states she was in
her normal state of health prior to developing pain. She did not
want to go see her MD, but one day prior to transfer her pain
worsened and she finally went to [**Hospital6 **].  At
LGH intital labs were notable for a lipase of 2254 which trended
upward to 8117, normal Cr and WBC of 22. Initial BUN was 22 but
subsequently trended upward to 30. RUQ US revealed common bile
duct dilitation and an abnormal appearance of her pancreas. She
was given metronidazole and levofloxacin and admitted to the
general medical floor where she was kept NPO and given IVF. CT
scan of her abdomen and pelvis was performed and was concerning
for necrosis, therefore were was transferred to the ICU where
aggressive fluid repletion was initiated (at the time of
transfer she has recieved 7 L. HCT demonstrated
hemoconcentration (54) which remained stable despite fluids.
Antitbiotics were broadened to imipenem. She remained
hemodynamically stable, afebrile, with UOP of 60 cc/hr
overnight.

Initial plan was for ERCP however the afternoon of transfer the
patient developed an acute desaturation event to 88% on 5L NC.
Saturations improved to 96% with 50% FiO2 via a venti mask. ABG
at that time was 7.17/46.2/81.7 bicarb of 17. She was intubated
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. On transport she was noted to be
transiently hypotensive to the 80s requiring peripheral levophed
which was weaned off on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. No ROS was obtained
due to the patient being unconcious.

Of note [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] records the patient has a history
of chronic nausea and intolerance of greasy food, however the
family denies any previous diagnosis of gallbladder disease. The
patient does not drink alcohol, has no new medication but does
have HL for which she has been on pravastatin.

On arrival to the MICU on [**2141-6-14**], patient's VS 157/79 105 18 95%
on CMV with RR 16, Vt 400, FiO2 60%. The patient was intubated
and sedated due to ARDS. LIJ central venous catheter was placed
given access issues. She was extubated on [**2141-6-20**] and was
transfered to the medicine floor and was treated for VAP from
[**Date range (3) 112125**] with zosyn and vancomycin (cipro was started
initially, but subsequently discontinued). On [**2141-6-23**], she was
transfered back to the ICU, re-intubated for hypoxia thought to
be due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions and a
questionable infarct in the [**Date Range **] without thrombus, which was not
anticoagulated. On [**2141-6-24**], she was noted to have ARF with rare
eos (AIN), which was thought to be due to medications/contrast
dye exposure. Several potential offending agents were
discontinued. On ECHO on [**6-26**] was wnl. Her initial tachycardia
later improved with verapamil. A LUQ u/s showed no gallstones
and minimal sludge.

[**2141-6-14**]
CT abdomen/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive necrotizing pancreatitis without gas formation.
2.  Peripancreatic inflammatory fat stranding and free fluid in
the
retroperitoneum, pelvis and perihepatic locations.  Distended
gallbladder with
sludge and possibly stones, though no ductal dilatation is seen.

3.  Patent portal venous system, though the splenic artery is
attenuated.

RUQ U/S
[**2141-6-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Gallbladder filled with sludge and gallstones.  No evidence
of
choledocholithiasis or definite cholecystitis at this time.
2.  Rounded heterogeneous segment II liver lesion without
correlation to CT two days prior.  This could be focal fatty
sparing but other lesions such as FNH could be missed on CT in
equilibrium phase.  When the patient's condition improves, a
repeat ultrasound should be obtained.
3.  Echogenic liver is most consistent with fatty deposition.
More advanced liver disease such as fibrosis or cirrhosis can
not be excluded on this study.

CT abdomen and pelvis [**2141-6-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Redemonstration of necrotizing pancreatitis with unchanged
distribution of pancreatic necrosis. Interval increase in
peripancreatic fluid around on the tail of the pancreas and
gastric greater curvature, but fluid collections do not appear
organized.
2. Moderate nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

Echo [**2141-6-26**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

LENIs [**6-26**]
The visualized vessels are patent and compressible with normal
flow
and augmentation. No thrombus is identified. There is normal
phasicity
within the common femoral veins bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.

[**2141-6-27**]: renal US:
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

CT chest from [**6-25**]
Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm, for which a followup CT
in three to six months is recommended if the patient is high
risk for malignancy and 6 to 12 months if low risk for
malignancy based on [**Last Name (un) 8773**] study guidance.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Severe, necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis: Resolved. Most
likely gallstone pancreatitis though LFT pattern not c/w
prolonged obstruction. Imaging at outside hospital demonstrated
the presence of stones in addition to common bile duct
dilitation. She was initially treated with meropenem  which was
discontinued after several days. Surgery and ERCP services were
consulted and suggested supportive medical management of
pancreatitis. ERCP was deferred during acute disease state given
that no obstructing stones were identified on CT and RUQ U/S.
After acute disease state resolves, she will require lap
cholecystectomy or ERCP with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).

#. Hypoxemic/hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Resolved. Initial
episode of respiratory failure was thought to be due to ARDS, as
well as bilateral effusions and some vascular congestion,
suggesting volume overload in the setting of aggressive volume
resuscitation. After pt's pancreatitis started to improve, she
was aggressively diuresed and weaned off of sedation and the
ventilator. She did not have a cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given
steroids for 24hrs and was ultimately extubated.

After extubation, pt was called out to general medical floor on
[**6-23**]. Within 24hrs, she developed worsening mental status and
increased work of breathing. She was found to be hypercarbic on
ABG. Despite aggressive diuresis and a trial of bipap, pt's CO2
did not improve, so she was re-intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. After
intubation, a bronchoscopy was performed that did not reveal any
evidence of lobar infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pna.
BAL cx was negative. A CTA was performed that revealed relative
[**Name (NI) 20534**] of [**Name (NI) **] consistent with ischemic changes, but no
thrombus was identified. LENIs were performed and did not
demonstrate any evidence of clot and echo did not show right
heart strain. She was also noted to have persistent bilateral
pleural effusions. Due to the fact that no definitive clot was
found and she clinically improved, a decision was made to not
anticoagulate. She was extubated on [**2141-6-28**], and approximately
15min after, she developed stridor and increased wob. She was
treated with steroids, racemic epinephrine and heliox for
presumed laryngeal edema. After several hours her respiratory
status improved and within 24 hrs she was weaned to nasal
cannula. Chest X-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion
despite persistent ataelectasis. On discharge she was
comfortable at rest and with ambulation on room air.

#. Ventilator associated pneumonia: On [**2141-6-20**], she developed
worsening fevers and increased sputum production. Other sources
of infection were investigated (normal U/A, abdomen imaging
unchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for VAP
with vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin. Pt completed a 8 day
treatment course for VAP. No current evidence of infectious
process

#. Acute renal failure: Thought to be AIN after being exposed to
cipro and zosyn, both of which can cause AIN. Renal U/S was
performed and did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis. Pt's
cr continued to improve (last 1.2) and she continued to have
good urine output.

#. Tachycardia: Improved with treatment of acute disease and
with restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (PCP confirmed
that both are for hypertension).

#. Insomnia/delerium: Was previously on olanzapine for steroid
vs. ICU induced delerium. She responded well however complained
of increased insomnia. Olanzapine was discontinued and Trazodone
was ordered.

#. Diabetes: She has had fluctuating blood sugars. Initial
hyperglycemia treated with SSI and lantus resulted in next day
hypoglycemia. Resolution of hypoglycemia achieved with D5W and
holding insulin. Hyperglycemic again on [**2141-7-2**] with glucose in
400s. She was continued on gentle HISS while NPO. She was
ultimately transition back to glargine and HISS. The diabetes
service saw the patient and also adjusted her insulin dosing.

#. Hypertension, benign: Held home amlodpine, lisinopril and
verapamil initially on admission. She was restarted on verapamil
and metoprolol.

#. Peripheral Vascular Disease:
- Continue home dose of ASA

# Anemia: Hct on admission in the 40's, now 23. Improved from
yesterday. Iron studies c/w anemia of CD with ferritin of 859.
Normocytic. LDH is elevated, but bili is normal and coags are
normal so hemolysis and DIC seem less likely causes.
-consider transfusion if hct <21

# Leukocytosis, thrombocytosis: Peaked on [**6-30**]. UA negative.
Afebrile. Suspect that this may have been related to aspiration
as her WBC and platelets are now improving.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with severe pancreatitis from gallstones. You
were treated supportively during this and you improved. You
required intubation (breathing tube) twice to support your
breathing. You were treated for pneumonia, acute kidney failure
and aspiration. You are now improving and being sent to an acute
rehabilitation facility.

In the future it will be important for you to have a
cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) in [**2-10**] months, once you
have completely recovered from this hospitalization.

You will also need to have follow up imaging (CT scan) of your
lungs in 6 months given the pulmonary nodules found during this
admission.

Some of your medications have changed:
We have stopped actos and metformin. These were changed to
insulin while you were sick. Once you go home you can restart
these.
We have stopped amlodipine.
We have halved your lisinopril.
We have started trazodone, simethicone, senna, colace,
bisacodyl, insulin and lidocaine patch.


Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow up appointment with your primary care
doctor within 2 weeks of leaving rehab.
