History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 68 yo active retired man with hemochromatosis,
cirrhosis and DM, who had a mechanical fall 2 weeks prior to
admission while at his winter home in [**State 108**].  After falling,
he developed left sided rib pain (later found to be due to rib
fracture), and sought care at the local ED, where he was told to
take tylenol. After continuing to have pain for several more
days he returned to the ED and was prescribed motrin for the rib
pain. He reports taking 600mg every 4-5 hrs for 3-4 days. He
also reports having very diminished appetite and eating and
drinking very little during this time. Three days PTA, he
developed SOB. At the urging of his children, he flew back from
FL to be seen here in [**Location (un) 86**]. In addition to decreased PO
intake, he reported insomnia and nausea/dry heaves.  He denied
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, sick contacts, or travel out of
the country.
.
On admission, EKG showed right heart strain and possible lateral
ischemic changes.  Pulmonary embolism was considered; V/Q scan
was read as low probability. Acute coronary syndrome was also
considered, and cardiac enzymes were elevated with troponin 0.12
and MB index 14.8. Heparin gtt was started, along with ASA and
beta blocker. Also on admission, he was found to have lactic
acidosis in setting of ARF (creatinine 3.4 with baseline 1.1)
with serum lactate 3.9 --> 6.7 and Anion Gap of 25.  Serum
potassium was 6.0 and bicarb 12. He was given bicarb gtt for
acidosis and kayexelate, insulin and glucose for elevated K.
.
Initial temp was 94.4 and CXR showed vague opacity in RML.
Blood cultures were drawn and levo/vanc started.  In the ED,
patient has 2 transient episodes of hypotension which resolved
spontaneously.  He was admitted to the MICU.

STUDIES:
.
#. V/Q scan [**2143-1-7**]
INTERPRETATION:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate very heterogenous ventilation with numerous
subsegmental defects bilaterally. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show numerous small bilateral non-segmental defects. These
defects are in the same areas as the ventilation defects, but
are less prominent. The AP dimension is enlarged, and the
diaphgrams are flattened. The chest x-ray is clear.
The above findings are consistent with a low probability for
pulmonary embolism, but are consistent with COPD.
.
#. TTE [**2143-1-8**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate-severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w a primary pulmonary
process.
.
#. ECG [**2143-1-9**]
Sinus rhythm, right ventricular hypertrophy, Diffuse ST-T wave
changes with borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal Q-Tc
interval - could be due in part to right ventricular hypertrophy
but clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of
[**2143-1-8**], further ST-T wave changes present and Q-Tc interval
appears short.
.
#. CT chest with Contrast [**2143-1-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right loculated collection which has high CT attenuation
value and may represent either empyema or hemorrhage within
pleural effusion.
2. Right lower lobe opacity with bronchial wall thickening which
may represent pneumonia/aspiration.
3. Right basilar atelectasis.
4. Small left pleural effusion.
5. Ground-glass opacity in the right apex. This should be
followed up with a CT in three months.
6. Focal ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe may represent infectious/inflammatory etiology. This
could also be followed up on the CT which will be obtained in
three months.
7. Atherosclerotic coronary calcifications.
8. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
9. Liver granulomas.
.
#. Renal US [**2143-1-10**]:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9 cm in length, previously
measuring 9.5 cm. The left kidney measures 10.2 cm in length,
previously measuring 10.7 cm in length. In the interpolar region
of the right kidney, there is an area with lobulated appearance
consistent with cortical scarring, unchanged from the prior
study. In the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is a
tiny cortical crystal. There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or
renal masses. There is no perirenal fluid. The bladder is
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval decrease in size in both kidneys.
2. There is no hydronephrosis.
3. Stable area of cortical scarring in the right kidney.
.
#. TEE [**2143-1-15**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably
normal.
3. There are complex (>4mm) sessile atheroma in the aortic arch.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.
7. No evidence of endocarditis seen.
.
#. CTA Chest [**2143-1-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Unchanged right loculated collection within the pleural space
of hyperattenuation. Given the appearance with increased
subpleural fat, this has the appearance of chronic right
effusion. It is difficult to comment on possible thickening of
the pleura.
3. Small left simple effusion, slightly increased from the prior
study.
4. 3-mm nodule in the right middle lobe. In the absence of known
malignancy, one-year CT followup could be considered.
5. Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.
6. Cirrhosis of the liver, with low-attenuation oval lesion near
the dome. It is incompletely characterized on the study.
7. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.
8. Left lateral fifth and seventh rib fractures.
9. Cystic structure above the manubrial notch without
enhancement, incompletely characterized on this study.
.
#. Core biopsy of R solid pleural effusion [**2143-1-17**]
.
#. Stress test [**2143-1-21**]
Exercising stress test: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from
baseline. N
Persantine MIBI: Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting
and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 71%. No prior
studies are available for comparison. IMPRESSION: Normal
myocardial perfusion. EF 71%.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Anion Gap Acidosis:
Was likely due to lactic acidosis given his high lactate on
admission. High lactate production likely occurred [**1-17**] sepsis
and poor perfusion, and ARF prevented clearance of lactate. Was
treated with bicarb in the ED and Gap resolved.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: resolved after receiving kayexelate, insulin
and glucose in ED.
.
#. RV strain/Pulmonary Hypertension:
On [**1-8**] TTE was obtained and showed a dilated RV with severe
global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement. He
was also noted to have moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension consistent with a primary pulmonary process.  LVEF
was >55%. Elevated tropinins measured in the ED were thought to
be due to RV strain combined with decreased renal clearance. By
[**1-9**], troponin had trended down and heparin gtt was
discontinued. For his pulmonary hypertension observed on echo, a
pulmonary consult was obtained. Acute PE was thought to be an
unlikely cause of his echo findings given the negative V/Q scan
on admission, but chronic PE was thought to be a possibility.
CTA was obtained on [**1-16**], which was negative. Other etiologies
were considered, including porto-pulmonary hypertension from
cirrhosis. HIV, [**Doctor First Name **] and RF were sent and found to be negative.
Scleroderma antibody test is pending. He will undergo an
outpatient work-up for pulmonary hypertension with PFTs, sleep
study, and outpatient appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
#. Hypoxia:
The patient was dyspneic on admission, and was maintained on
supplemental oxygen for oxygen saturations that dropped into the
high 80's at rest on room air. This was thought to be related to
a presumed RML pneumonia (seen as opacity on admission CXR) and
underlying pulmonary hypertension seen on Echo. However, the
opacity observed on CXR was not seen on CT from [**1-16**], so it is
unlikely that the original opacity represented a pneumonia as
originally thought. His dyspnea slowly improved, and he was
weaned from supplemental oxygen by [**1-14**]. However, on [**1-15**] he
again developed an oxygen requirement after IV fluids were
initiated in preparation for receiving IV contrast, and on [**1-16**],
resting oxygen saturation was measured at 89% on room air at
rest, 85% while ambulating. CTA [**1-16**] showed an enlarged
left-sided pleural effusion (fluid density) and a R-sided
pleural effusion that was determined to be solid on
thorocentesis (Path result is pending). These findings, in
combination with his pulmonary hypertension and deconditioning
were thought to account for the patient's continued hypoxia.
Diuresis was initiated the following day, and satrurations
improved, but he continued to have an oxygen requirement. He had
also been noted to have worsened dyspnea while ambulating, and a
stress test was performed to rule-out an anginal component.
Stress test was normal, showing no ECG changes or anginal
component and normal myocardial perfusion with Ejection Fraction
of 71%. By discharge, oxygen saturations were 98% on 3L, and he
was discharged home on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure:
On admission, the patient had a creatinine level of 3.4. This
appeared to be related to a prerenal state, as supported by his
history of very poor PO intake x 10 days and FENa<1%. The
possibility of ATN from NSAIDs was also considered given his
recent history of taking Motrin for pain, and renal followed the
patient until Cr had improved. Renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis. Creatinine slowly improved with IVF and time,
and had decreased to 1.2 by [**1-16**] (most recent baseline
measurement was 1.1 in [**2140**]). When the patient's home diuretics
were subsequently restarted for hyponatremia and fluid overload,
Cr rose again to 1.6. By discharge, the patient's creatinine was
1.4.
.
#. Staph Bacteremia:
Blood cultures on admission grew MSSA (4/4 bottles from [**1-7**]).
Renally-dosed vancomycin was started on [**1-8**], then switched to
oxacillin on [**1-10**] when sensitivities returned. 2/2 blood
cultures from [**1-10**] also grew staph aureus. Surveillance cultures
since then have been negative. TEE done [**1-15**] not show any
valvular abnormalities. A PICC line was placed on [**1-12**] and the
patient completed a 14-day course of IV antibiotics on [**2143-1-22**]
and the PICC was removed prior to discharge.
.
#. Hyponatremia:
While in the ICU, the patient had one set of serum chemistries
with serum sodium of 122. Remainder of values were in 130s until
fluids were started on [**1-14**] in preparation for CTA with dye
load. Next measured Na was 127 on [**1-16**]. He was fluid restricted
to 1500cc/day and encouraged to improve his food intake, which
had been poor throughout his admission. Given that he also had
evidence of total body fluid overload (peripheral and abdominal
edema), he was restarted on his home diuretic regimen of Lasix
20mg and spironolactone 25mg. By [**1-22**], Na had risen to 131.
.
#. UTI:
Urine labs from [**1-9**] showed UTI, for which the patient was
treated with a 7 day course of Levofloxacin that finished on
[**1-16**]. Urine Cx was negative, but was sent after the patient had
started Levofloxacin and Vancomycin. Fever curve remained flat.
.
#. Anxiety: The patient consistently reported having a "nervous
stomach" that felt like it had "knots in it." He has had these
sensations for many years, and reported that it made eating
difficult because it caused him to feel nauseus. This was
thought to be a manifestation of anxiety, and the patient was
tried on 0.5mg of Ativan. This was subsequently discontinued
when he was found to be excessively somnolent. The patient
agreed to start Remeron for help with anxiety and appetite
stimulation. He tolerated it well and was discharged on 15mg
Remeron QHS.
.
#. DM: The patient recived QID finger sticks and was treated
with bedtime glargine and ISS. Blood glucose measurments
fluxuated with his PO intake and adjustments were made as
appropriate.
.
#. Hypertension/ CAD: The patient was treated with ASA 325mg and
Metoprolol 12.5mg TID. As the patient had no apparent indication
for digoxin, this was held during his hospitalization. He was
discharged on atenolol 12.5mg daily and ASA 325mg daily. Stress
test revealed no hypoperfusion at rest or with persantine
stimulation.
.
#. Nutrition:
Albumin was 2.6 on admission, 2.4 on [**1-16**]. The patient reported a
10 day history of anorexia on admission and continued to have
poor PO intake throughout most of his hospitalization. He cited
lack of appetite and nausea caused by his "nervous stomach" as
reasons for his poor intake. The patient was maintained on a
renal diet with liquid supplements (Boost) TID. He had poor
compliance until 2 days prior to discharge, when he reported an
increase in appetite and improved PO intake was recorded.
.
#. Hemochromatosis/cirrhosis: Remained stable during this
hospitalization.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: Remained stable. He was treated with his home
dose of Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily during this admission.
.
# Physical Therapy: The patient was evaluated and followed by
PT, who felt he was safe to return to his daugter's home.
.
# Prophylaxis:
The patient was treated with incentive spirometry, H2 blocker,
and SC heparin (which was discontinued when he began ambulating)
.
#. Abnormal tests requiring outpatient follow-up:
Seen on CTA [**2143-1-16**]:
1. 3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
2. hypodense oval lesion approx 8mm at the liver dome.
