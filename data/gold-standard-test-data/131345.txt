Chief Complaint:
right leg pain, hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
blood transfusion x2


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple
admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED
complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain.  The pain
is worst when she tried to bear weight on the leg, or when she
uses it to roll over or adjust her position in bed.  The pain
begins in her buttock and travels down the posterior thigh and
calf but stops before reaching the ankle.  It occasionally feels
like it is coming from her low back.  She denies any
parasthesias or weakness in the leg, and she denies any numbness
in her foot or groin.  She denies any fevers or incontinence.
The pain was unrelieved by Vicodin that she had at home, so she
scheduled an urgent visit with her nephrologist yesterday
[**2141-9-4**].  At her nephrologist??????s office, she was hypertensive to
250/145 and so she was referred to the ED.  She ended up leaving
the ED against medical advice yesterday, but returned today
because of persistent leg pain.  She reports that she took all
of her morning and noon BP meds.



She denies any fevers, headaches, visual changes, nausea (prior
to coming to the ED), or leg weakness.



Upon arrival to the ED today, she was afebrile, BP 237/146, HR
97, RR 16, Sat 100% on room air.  She received a total of 90 mg
of IV labetalol and nitropaste, and was eventually put on a
labetalol drip for her hypertension.  With these interventions,
her SBP dropped to the 180s, but she reported feeling nauseous
and so the drip was discontinued.  She was also given 4 mg of IV
morphine and 1 mg of IV hydromorphone for her leg pain with
decent relief.  Due to a urinalysis suggestive of infection, she
was given one tablet of DS TMP/SMX.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple
admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED
complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain. She was
initially admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and then
transfered to the floor after a day.

# Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED,
but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was
coming down too fast).  She was started on her home meds and
tolerated these fairly well.  Transferred to the floor and noted
to have SPBs in the 90s.  She required 1L IVF bolus since her
baseline SBP is thought to run in the 130-170 range.  She also
had transient dizziness during this episode.  BP meds were held
and later that night her SBP was in the 220s.  BP meds
restarted.  She remained stable thereafter with SBPs in the
130-170s.  We opted to discharge her on her home regimen
(without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issues
with elevated blood pressures.
.
# Right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture
on plain film. MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no
acute pathology.  The pain was in the distribution of her right
hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting
a muscle injury.  CK was normal.  Pain was treated with dilaudid
initially.  On day of discharge, she was able to ambulate
without gait abnormality or pain.  PT saw her and rec outpt PT
followup.
.
# CKD V: PD catheter placement in place. Pt was tried on PD on a
number of occasions but did not tolerate it [**2-11**] pain.  KUB
confirmed tip in place.  Cx of peritoneal fluid not suggestive
of peritonitis.  K remained mildly elevated.  Hyperpara treated
with sevelamer (although patient refused) then tums.  Pt will
reconsider PD as outpatient.
.
# Anemia: chronic.  Received 2u pRBC while inhouse for Hct in
the 18-19 range.  Had appropriate response.  Not on Epo given
hypertension
.
# ID: Rx with cipro for ? UTI although urine cx neg.  Also had
temp to 101 on evening prior to discharge.  No clear source.  PD
fluid cultured and NGTD.  Pt remainded HD stable on day of
discharge.
.
# Prior SVC thrombus. Continued warfarin with appropriate INR
checks.  INR elevated on day of discharge.  Rec holding coumadin
for 2d
.
# Systemic lupus erythematosus: cont home prednisone dose
.
# Dispo status: ambulating, pain free, BP in the 150/90 range

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
- HTN urgency
- right leg pain - thought [**2-11**] hamstring injury
- chronic kidney disease - not currently on dialysis
- SLE
- anemia [**2-11**] CKD and SLE
- hx of SVC thrombosis on coumadin now
Secondary:
- hx hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
- chronic thrombocytopenia


Discharge Condition:
ambulating without difficulty.  tolerating oral diet.  afebrile
and SBP in the 130-150 range.


Discharge Instructions:
You came in with right leg pain and poorly controlled
hypertension.  Your blood pressure was controlled initially with
IV medications then your home medications.  Since your blood
pressure was occasionally low, we recommend that you hold your
labetalol if you are feeling lightheaded or have dizziness or
have blood pressure less than 110/60.

In terms of your leg pain, we performed xrays, ultrasound, and
MRI without finding a cause.  We suspect a hamstring injury
given its location.  Please take pain medications if needed.  We
recommend followup with physical therapy.

You also had a fever which is suggestive of infection.  We
treated you with cipro in case you had a UTI.  Otherwise, your
cultures were unrevealing.

We attempted peritoneal dialysis but this was unsuccessful.
Please followup with your nephrologist.

Please return to the ED if you experience headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath, high fevers, or worsening leg pain.

Please hold your coumadin for two days then restart as per
previously written.  Please take lactulose for constipation.
