Chief Complaint:
hypothermia, behavioral changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
35 year-old woman with microcephaly, psychosis, and mental
retardation who has been noted by group home members to have
increased somnolence, unsteady gait and poor PO intake over the
past month in the setting of multiple medication changes. This
has prompted consideration for admission to a psychiatric
facility in order to change medications, and she was brought to
the ED for medical clearance but was found to be hypothermic
with a temp of 32.

At her baseline, she can feed herself and dress herself if given
clothes, but she is dependent on others for all other ADLs. She
occasionally mutters phrases and most of the time replies to
questions with "yes" or "no." usually she has violent outbursts,
and staff has been getting concerned that she seems more
sluggish recently. She has had poor urine output over the past
week. Has been constipated. She has had a rash for over a year
that was recently biopsied by her PCP and is currently on
Fluconazole. In addition, she has had insomnia, poor oral
intake, and has been stumbling/falling to one side when walking.
In the past, she has been sent to a psychiatric facility for
changes to her medication regimen; she was sent to the ED for
medical clearance.

In the ED initial vital signs were remarkable for a temperature
of 32, TSH 7.7 but otherwise normal labs with lactate, negative
UA, CXR and head CT after receiving a total of 20mg PO Haldol.
She was placed on a Bair hugger and received 2 liters of warm NS
with improvement of her temperature to 32.9. No nuchal rigidity
or signs of infection. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
monitoring and rewarming. At transfer, vitals were 32.9 (91.2),
71, 99/67, 13, 94% RA.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was alert, but not responding to
questions or commands.  The patient was brought back to normal
body temperature and then transferred to the floor.

[**2139-10-28**] RENAL ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION: No renal or urinary bladder abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
35 year-old woman with mental retardation since childhood
presenting with mental status changes, ataxia, poor PO intake,
and thrombocytopenia admitted with hypothermia, temperature 32C.
 She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was warmed up
to euthermia and subsequently transferred to the floor.
Surveillance for infections was negative.  Psychiatry was
consulted to assess for possible medication related symptoms.  A
swollen lower lip and swollen tongue and shortness of breath
prompted an eval by ENT to r/o vocal cord edema. Workup for
angioedema was initiated.

Hypothermia: The duration of her hypothermia is unclear as she
previously refused vital signs for weeks. Her hypothermia could
have been related to underlying mental retardation and inability
to seek warmth or side effect from her antipsychotic
medications.  Her core temperature increased to the lower range
of normal after warming with Bair hugger and receiving 2 liters
of warmed saline in the ER. SHe did not show evidence of septic
physiology.  slightly elevated TSH but normal T4 indicating sick
euthyroid but this is not the cause of the patients hypothermia.


Ataxia: She has had ataxia for approximately one month which
could be an effect of hypothermia or related to her underlying
neurologic disease.  She had a head CT that did not show any
acute findings.  She continued to improve as an inpatient and
was walking independently (at her baseline) on her own prior to
discharge

Poor oral intake: She had poor PO intake at her group home and
was seen by speech and swallow who recommended soft solids and
thin liquids with meds whole or crushed in puree. Her mental
status improved and she was able to take regular diet.

Poor urine output: She had poor urine output at group home, but
after foley placement she had 1200cc urine output. This may be
due to a medication side effect (she is on anticholinergics to
prevent side effects from antipsychotics). Also has had poor
oral intake recently.  After her foley was discontinued and she
had ongoing urinary retention that required intermittent
catheterization. Urology was consulted and recommended scheduled
intermittent catheterization and Cystex tid. Patient frequently
refuses catheterization, nurses have had better luck with the
catheterization about 1-2 hours after antipsychotics given. All
anticholinergics were stopped, including Cogentin, with some
improvement in her bladder volumes. It is unclear if there is a
behavioral component to her urinary retention. Her urinary
retention was of moderate volume and a BUN / Cr were stable
(Creatinine 0.7) on [**11-2**], she has outpt urology appt scheduled.
Given the urinary retention she is at risk for urinary tract
infections, the patient's group home staff was informed of signs
of a UTI such as delerium / agitation / other behavioral changes
or urinary changes (frequency/odor) which should prompt referral
to a physician for workup of UTI.

Rash: She was seen by dermatology who confirmed with scrapings
that it was fungal.  Patient has been on fluconazole for this
and dermatology recommended swithcing to topical terbinafine
which improved her tinea corporis significantly. She will follow
up with dermatology in [**2139-12-30**].

Mental Retardation and agitation:  Her home psychiatric
medications were continued including a slightly lower dose
risperdal, at 5mg po bid. The psychiatric consultants felt that
given the patient's behavior has returned to baseline it may be
best to avoid transition to clozaril as previously discussed
given the greater propensity for anticholinergic side effects
and that if behavioral issues and agitation issues do arise
perhaps increasing the dose of risperdal should be the first
step in management rather than an alternative anti-psychotic.

Sick euthyroid: Mild TSH elevation to 7.7 with normal free T4.
This should be repeated as an outpatient to screen for
hypothyroidism.

Thrombocytopenia: This could be a side effect of her numerous
psychiatric medications or fluconazole. This remained stable
during her hospital stay and subsequently improved to normal.

Inflammation: she had an elevated ESR and CRP of unclear
etiology, very non-specific. [**Doctor First Name **] was negative. Consider
repeating these in [**1-31**] months after discharge.

In regards to returning to normal activity she is cleared to
return to her workshop and other normal daily activities as of
date of discharge, [**2139-11-3**].

Discharge Diagnosis:
Hypothermia
Agitation
Urinary retention


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for low body temperature. This
improved with warming in the ICU. This may have been due to your
antipsychotic medications. You also developed some agitation in
the hospital and it was felt that you may benefit from an
adjustment in your psychiatric medications. You had some urinary
retention, also likely due to medications which required
intermittent catheterization.  This problem has improved
somewhat but you should still see a urologist, this appointment
has been made for you.
