Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1491**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with banding


History of Present Illness:
 46 yo F s/p liver transplant '[**05**] for acute Hep A who is
undergoing liver/kidney transplant eval at [**Hospital1 18**] had colonoscopy
and EGD on [**7-31**] which was notable for grade 3 varices which were
banded and an unremarkable colonoscopy. However, she developed
abd pain after the colonoscopy. She went home, noted severe abd
pain and presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital. Presented with mildly
increased distension of abdomen - KUB and CT showed no free air,
but did show increased air in colon which could have resulted
from [**Last Name (un) **]. [**Hospital3 **] spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] who recommended
paracentesis, but they did not feel comfortable doing this.
Therefore, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] requested she receive a dose of ceftriaxone
and be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient had a diagnostic and therapeutic
paracentesis which drained 2.7L of amber liquid. Peritoneal
fluid was negative for SBP with 31 WBC, culture pending. She
also received phenergan, morphine, and 1000cc NS.
.
The patient was admitted to medicine for further evaluation of
abdominal pain. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient had 3
episodes of coffee ground emesis (approx 350cc total) with a 6
point drop in Hct. Liver fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended IV
protonix, octreotide, and transfer to MICU for emergent EGD and
monitoring. In the MICU an EGD was performed which showed grade
III varices which were banded. Following this procedure and
multiple blood transfusion, her Hct has stabilized at 34.  Given
persistent complaints of tense abdomen and pain, have made
multiple attempts to repeat paracentesis - hindered by dilated
loops of bowel. As her HCT remains stable she was transfered
back to medicine for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 y/o female w/ h/o liver transplant for Hep A c/b cirrhosis,
and grade 3 esophageal varices, originally admitted with diffuse
abdominal pain after colonscopy, now with coffee ground emesis x
3 s/p EGD with banding of varices and persisting ascites.
.
1) UPPER GI BLEED: pt w/ coffee ground emesis on [**8-1**] had grade
3 varices on EGD [**8-1**], banded. She received a total of 3 U PRBC
during  MICU course. She is now hemodynamically stable and her
HCT has remained stable since transfusions. Patient recieved
Octreotide for total of 5 days  Patient continued on Protonix 40
mg po BID. Patient given sucralfate. Nadolol was held.
.
2) ABDOMINAL PAIN - There was concern for perforation given
recent colonoscopy; however, X-ray and Abd CT @ OSH did not show
evidence of free air, and repeat upright CXR @ [**Hospital1 18**] shows no
free air. Also considered was SBP from bacterial translocation
from colonoscopy. Pt received ceftriaxone at OSH, but pt only
had 31 WBC by paracentesis. Abdominal pain improved since
initial paracentesis in ED; now ascites redeveloped and pain has
returned. Ceftriaxone/Rifaximin was given immunosuppression and
elevated WBC. She recieved morphine prn for pain.
.
A second paracentesis was attempted; however only 10 cc of fluid
was removed. She was then taken to have U/S-guided paracentesis,
but found to have significantly dilated loops of bowel which
hindered further attempts. On repeat US guided paracentesis for
[**8-6**] for symptomatic relieve was successful. Her abdominal pain
resolved prior to discharge.
.
3) RENAL FAILURE - likely [**1-24**] to nephrotoxity from cyclosporin;
appears to have resolved as pt's creatinine at baseline of 2.2.
She was given 25 grams of Albumin after her paracentesis. Her
medications were renally dosed
.
4) CIRRHOSIS - Cirrhosis of transplanted liver is thought to be
[**1-24**] to prior noncompliance with immunosuppressive meds. Patient
being evaluated for a re-transplant by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28609**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. pt
intially w/ varices and now w/ asterixis. possibly
enephalopathic due to increased urea load w/ GIB. Her
encephalopathy resolved. Decreased cyclosporin to 50 qd and
started sirolimus 4 mg qd on [**8-3**].
She continued Lactulose and rifamixin for encephalopathy ppx.
Diuretics were held given GIB and renal dysfunction. She
continued prednisone. Her cyclosporin and sirolimus levels were
checked.
.
5) DIARRHEA - likely related to Lactulose, resolved prior to
discharge
.
