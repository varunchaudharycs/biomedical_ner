Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, lightheadedness, weakness, leg heaviness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of Right Interior Jugular central line
Transesophageal Echocardiogram
DC Cardioversion with conscious sedation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51yo M w/ PMH of HTN and afib dx one week ago
who presented to his PCP today [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ SOB, leg heaviness,
lightheadedness, weakness and fatigue. Found to be hypotensive
(SBP in 60s) and bradycardic (HR 30s). EMS was called and
transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In the ER, he was given
atropine x2, glucagon, calcium and 1.5L NS. EKGs showed
bradycardia at rate of ~30, with no definite P waves, but a
baseline suggestive of afib/flutter. No qwaves, no ST or T wave
changes. He was still hypotensive so a R IJ was placed and he
was started on a dopamine gtt at 15 mcg/hr.
.
Was diagnosed w/ afib about a week ago. Had a persistent chest
cold for approx. 3 weeks, went to see his PCP who examined him
and found him to be in rapid afib w/ HR of 170s by EKG. From his
PCP's office, he was sent to the ER at [**Hospital6 **]. He
was admitted and was finally rate controlled in the ED (to HR of
96) after 35mg IV diltiazem and 60mg PO diltiazem. Was d/c on
atenolol and diltiazem on [**12-29**] and represented to the ER on [**12-31**]
via EMS because of SOB, lightheadedness, and 3 episodes of chest
pressure at home. He was observed overnight, r/o MI by 3 sets of
neg CE and had a stress test which was negative. He was then
sent home on [**1-1**]. He decided at that point that perhaps his
symptoms were due to his warfarin so he started taking 2mg QHS
instead of 5mg QHS as instructed. He continued to take the
atenolol and diltiazem as instructed. Today, he felt well when
he woke up but began to have symptoms of lightheadedness, SOB,
and leg heaviness about an hour after he took his medications.
He went to his PCP's office, as he had a previously scheduled
appointment, and she called EMS who brought him here.
.
ROS: denies CP, palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting or any
sort of pain associated w/ these episodes; no PND, orthopnea
currently (though did complain of those a week ago); no f/c, no
further symptoms of his chest cold (no cough, rhinorrhea or sore
throat); no diarrhea, constipation or BRBPR, no urinary sx

.
Imaging:
[**1-3**] CXR - There are no prior studies available for comparison.
There is a right internal jugular vein line, with its tip at the
superior vena cava/right atrial junction. No pneumothorax is
seen. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal for
technique. The pulmonary vascularity is normal in appearance
without redistribution. No pleural effusions are seen, though
the extreme right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the
study. There are no focal consolidations.
.
[**2163-1-5**] TEE -
1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated.
2.The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left
ventricular function is hard to assess given that the
ventricular rate is very rapid but there is probably moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis with an EF of 35-40%.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is borderline normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No thrombus in the left or right atria. Moderate
global left
ventricular hypokinesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
51yo M w/ hypotension and bradycardia, likely in setting of CCB
and BB for his newly diagnosed afib.
.
# CV:
* Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 107906**] bradycardia was likely due to excessive
nodal blockade from CCB and BB since he recovered his rate and
BP off all nodal blocking agents. He then went back into rapid
afib, with HR up to 160s despite the addition of BB. His BP
remained stable so the decision was made to attempt
cardioversion. TEE showed no clot and DCCV was attempted but he
was only able to maintain NSR for ~30 sec. He continued to be in
afib w/ RVR, with a rate as high as 160-170. Diltiazem 30mg PO
QID was added, still with insufficient control of his rate. The
diltiazem dose was then increased to 60mg TID on [**1-6**] due to
persistent tachycardia with good effect on his rate. EP was
consulted to help guide the management of his arrhythmia and
they recommended discontinuing his diltiazem and instead
attempting to control his rhythm (and rate) with amiodarone. He
was started on 400mg PO TID x1 week, with the plan to decrease
to [**Hospital1 **] dosing x1 week then QD dosing. Once he had received an
adequate amiodarone load, the plan was to attempt another DCCV
as an outpatient. Mr. [**Known lastname **] discussed this plan with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**] who also wanted him to wear [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor
upon discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was instructed in the use of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
of Hearts monitor and was told to send in rhythm strips to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**] daily, so his rate and his intervals could be
monitored daily. Despite the initiation of amiodarone, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] also needed a beta-blocker to keep his rate under
control. His beta-blocker was slowly increased up to 75mg PO QID
and was then switched to Toprol XL 300mg PO QD prior to
discharge. The Toprol XL and amiodarone allowed Mr. [**Known lastname **] to
achieve a resting heart rate of 90-100s. Coumadin was started on
[**1-4**] with a goal INR of [**1-7**]. He was kept on a heparin gtt until
his INR was therapeutic. He was discharged on 3mg of coumadin
daily, and his INR on discharge was 2.4.
.
* Pump: Although Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no evidence of heart failure by
exam (lungs were CTAB and his JVP was flat), his OSH ECHO and
TEE here showed a depressed EF. After receiving IVF in the ER,
he had some swelling in his hands and feet which resolved on its
own. He never required diuresis with lasix.
.
* Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no evidence of ischemia. His CE
enzymes were negative x2. EKG has no evidence of ST or T wave
changes.
.
# ARF: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in mild ARF on admission, w/ Cr of 1.5 and
K of 5.8. It resolved after receiving several liters of IVF in
the ER. It was most likely prerenal +/- ATN from hypotension.
His Cr was 1.2 on discharge (lowest value was 1.0 during his
stay).
.
# FEN: He follwed a regular heart-healthy diet. No IVF were
needed. His electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted
prn to keep K >4 and Mg >2.
.
# ACCESS: He had a centrail line (R IJ) placed in the ER
initially, but it was pulled after TEE/DCCV. He then had
peripheral IVs for IV access.
.
# PPX: He was on heparin gtt as a bridge to coumadin until his
INR was therapeutic. He had a bowel regimen. No PPI was
indicated.

# DISPO: To home, with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor. Will follow up in
Dr.[**Name (NI) 107907**] office for INR checks.
