History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] is a 68 yo with met renal cell carc admitted on
[**2124-2-29**] for week 2 of high dose IL-2 therapy.  His last dose was
complicated by shock requiring dopamine and brief atrial
fibrillation, spontaneously reverting back when dopamine was
changed to neo.  His current course was given from [**2-29**] to [**3-4**]
and has been complicated by nausea/vomiting, encephalopathy,
diarrhea, rigors, and desquamation, but also by hypotension in
the 70s systolic requiring neo for 90 min on [**3-2**] and restarted
again on [**3-5**], ARF with decreasing UOP (355 total cc's on [**3-5**],
none on [**3-4**], + ~ 14L LOC but without detailed recording of his
UOP), and progressive metabolic acidosis despite bicarb
infusion.  Vancomycin was started empirically in the setting of
severe dermatitis, and he has been on prophylactic cipro
throughout his stay.  His last dose 9am on [**3-4**].  His Cr has
risen progressively from 1.9 on admission to 6.6 on the evening
of transfer.  Because of his progressive renal failure, dopamine
was added to improve renal perfusion.  He was also transiently
in afib.  His Tmax during his stay has been 99.5 on [**3-1**] with no
other elevated temps, though he has been intermittently around
95F.

[**2124-3-24**] hand x-ray
 No previous images. The distal [**Hospital1 **] and adjacent soft tissues
are
essentially within normal limits on the images presented. No
evidence of
erosions or dystrophic calcification.

[**2124-3-23**] CT abd/pelvis
1. Small bowel dilation without a clear transition point to
suggest
mechanical obstruction. A 7 cm segment of small bowel wall
thickening may
represent ischemia, infection, or inflammation. A repeated CT
with i.v.
contrast may help evaluate the transit of oral contrast as well
as the
mesenteric vasculature
2. Nasogastric tube just passed the gastroesophageal junction.
Consider
reposition of nasogastric tube in the body of the stomach.
3. Metastatic disease, incompletely evaluated on this
non-contrast study.
4. Bibasilar consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia
5. Florid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
6. Decrease in size of right adrenal nodule suggestive of
response to
therapy.
7. Extensive therosclerotis including coronary artery, abdominal
aorta and
mesenteric vessels.

[**2124-3-23**]
MRI head
1. Near-complete interval resolution of the enhancing lesion
within the left anterior temporal lobe. Only minimal residual
enhancement and FLAIR signal hyperintensity persist. No new
enhancing lesions are identified.

TTE [**2124-3-6**]:  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

TTE [**2124-3-8**]:  IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located
mostly posterior to the left ventricle. There is minimal fluid
anterior to the right ventricle. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, which can be consistent with impaired ventricular
filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the heart
rate. There is no frank tamponade seen. Normal biventricular
function. No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are
not well seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**],
this is a limited study. The valves are not well seen. The
patient remains tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation.
The size of the pericardial effusion is similar

Renal Ultrasound [**2124-3-6**]:
1. No hydronephrosis of the right kidney. Left kidney is
surgically absent.

CXR [**2124-3-6**]:
Lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature more engorged, and
distended
mediastinal veins, unchanged, pointing toward volume overload or
cardiac
decompensation. A more focal opacity at the left lung base
laterally would be better evaluated after hemodynamic status is
optimized. It could be a small region of infection or
infarction, pleural effusion, or transient atelectasis.

Heart is top normal size, though increased since yesterday.
Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.

CT head/chest non-con [**2124-3-7**]:

Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left
temporal lobe metastasis.

1. Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass
opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly
suggestive of drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced
eosinophilic lung disease). The more confluent lower lobe
opacities are most suggestive of atelectasis, although infection
cannot be excluded by imaging.

2. Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with
mild
interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. No significant interval change to some of the previously
noted metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci
obscured by the new lung parenchymal opacities. Slight
enlargement of prevascular lymph nodes can be seen in the
setting of underlying pulmonary edema/elevated CVP.

CXR [**2124-3-8**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, a new central
venous
access line has been inserted over the left anterior jugular
vein. The tip of the line projects over the upper SVC. There is
no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.

The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
position.

Also unchanged is the size of the cardiac silhouette and the
bilateral
multifocal parenchymal opacities. The retrocardiac opacity could
have
minimally increased in the interval.

Lower Extremity U/S:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity. Left
peroneal vein not well visualized.

BAL:  Bronchial lavage, right mid lobe:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, and
  neutrophils; no viral inclusions noted.

CXR [**2124-3-11**]:
Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 48 mm from the
carina, standard placement for patient of this size. Diffuse
infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, more pronounced in the
perihilar right lung has progressed could by virtue of asymmetry
be pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema, although pulmonary
vascular congestion is present. The heart is moderately
enlarged.  Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Right
jugular line ends in the low SVC, left jugular line in the mid
SVC, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of
view. Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal
station is due to a combination of adenopathy and venous
engorgement.

Portable Abdomen [**2124-3-10**]:
FINDINGS: Supine AP abdomen radiograph demonstrates a
nasogastric tube
following a normal course and terminating in the distal stomach.
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. The bowel gas shadow
appears unremarkable

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Shock: Felt initially most likely due to sepsis and he was
covered broadly with antibiotics.  Initially broadened
antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources.  Goal
CVP was [**9-21**], MAP > 65.  Initial central venous O2 saturation
was 91%.  Patient was transferred from floor to ICU on dopamine
and neo; dopamine was converted to levophed.  Pulsus was normal
at 5.  Echocardiogram as above, largely unremarkable.
Hypotension persisted and was thought to be septic in etiology
with IL-2 distributive physiology contributing.  Shock was
refractory to fluid boluses; received normal saline and water
with bicarb given renal failure.  Blood cultures eventually grew
out MRSA, successive cultures negative until [**2124-3-10**], with
[**2124-3-10**] culture growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
During this time, patient was actually weaned off pressors.  The
right subclavian triple lumen was removed and a right internal
jugular triple lumen was placed.  Goals of care were discussed
with family, who requested continued aggressive treatment.
Linezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia. The patient's
pressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.  He did not
have further hypotension after transfer to the oncology floor.

# MRSA/VRE bacteremia: S/p line removals; Patient completed 15
day course of linezolid.  Also added Meropenem on [**3-24**] given MS
decline and asterixis.  Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**3-25**] and
patient has been stable, afebrile without leukocytosis since.
Repeat blood and urine cultures have been negative.

# partial/early SBO: On [**3-25**] patient developed worsening
abdominal distention and confusion.  This early SBO was likely
due to narcotics though concerning that is ongoing and limiting
nutrition. MRI head with improved findings. An NGT was placed
for 24 hours and the patient's MS cleared as did his SBO.  There
was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic
positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd
findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.  Patient however
soon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was
not done.  He was able to tolerate a regular diet for 48H prior
to discharge. A PICC had been placed for access and for ability
to start TPN if needed, however TPN was never started.

# Anemia: likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, acute
nutrition, and marrow suppression.  Patient is also FOB+ s/p 2U
PRBC since [**3-17**]. then another 1U [**3-24**].  He was continued on iron,
folate and B12 on [**3-27**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] did have guiaic positive
stools during admission which should be followed-up  by
gastroenterology as an outpatient.

# gangrene: [**3-14**] pressors, shock as below.  Patient was treated
with wound care and transitioned to a fentanyl patch with
breakthrough morphine for pain.

# thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely due to myelosuppression.

# coagulopathy: Patient was supplemented with vitamin K X3 days
to decrease his INR.

#  Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated electively in
setting of persistent hypervolemia and renal failure.
Maintained on minimal ventilatory support during dialysis.
Patient received antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was extubated on [**2124-3-15**] and continued to improve
significantly. The patient was called out to the OMED floor team
for further managment.

#. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or
postrenal etiology also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though
stable from last draw.  Patient likely had IL-2 induced renal
injury, with possible ischemic acute tubular necrosis.  Despite
aggressive fluids, renal function did not improve.  Patient was
showing signs of uremia and hypervolemia, and continuous
[**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis was started following intubation and
placement of HD line.  On the last days of admission he did not
require diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine
of 1.1-1.3. He was not continued on his anti-hypertensives as
his SBPs were 130-140. Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] should have his renal function
checked as an outpatient in the next 1-2 weeks. If there are
concerns with worsening kidney function as an oupatient, he
should be followed by renal.

#  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- Occurred
on morning of [**2124-3-7**].  Became more hypotensive, received two
attempts at DC cardioversion, transient sinus rhythm restored,
then converted back into a. fib.  Amiodarone load and drip was
started.  Converted to sinus rhythm day later, maintained on
amio drip.  Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity
ultrasound negative for DVT.  Repeat TTE showed no right heart
strain. The amiodarone drip was discontinued and the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm.

#. HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can
cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical
picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely
toxic-metabolic.  CT head showed slight improvement in
metastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.  Lumbar puncture was
deferred given intracranial mass. As patient stayed on the
oncology floor his mental status gradually returned to [**Location 213**].
He can have a formal neurocognitive outpatient work-up if deemed
necessary by his PCP.

# skin/eye/mucous membrane breakdown: Patient developed
significant skin breakdown, particularly on his fingertips
likely due to pressors and IL-2.  He was evaluated by plastic
surgery and hand x-ray found no need for intervention.  He was
continued on: nystatin, miconazole, benadryl, sarna, Hydrocerin,
HydrOXYzine, eye drops, Gelclair.

#. RCC: finished week 2 of IL-2. Maintained contact with
outpatient oncologist.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
IL-2 therapy for your Renal Cell Carcinoma.  While you were here
you had a very complicated hospital course.

-You developed bacteria in your blood and you were treated with
antibiotics for MRSA and VRE. You have finished your courses of
antibiotics and your blood cultures have been normal.
-You had a UTI with e-coli and you were treated with
antibiotics. Your urine cultures have since been normal.
-You needed dialysis.  Your kidney function has since improved
and your creatinine was 1.2 at discharge.  This should be
monitored closely and you should see a renal doctor if it
worsens.
