Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Portacath removal ([**2117-10-7**])

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer
diagnosed [**11-5**] s/p whipple [**11-5**] who presents with fever to
102.8. Patient had a similar admission in [**8-6**] here for similar
reasons. Both times, the fever started shortly after port
access. During his admission in [**Month (only) **], no positive blood
cultures, negative urine cx, negative cxr, negative echo. Was
diagnosed with supraventricular tacchycardia and was given
adenosine and then lopressor to take at home. He was treated
with vanc and ceftriaxone and then ciprofloxacin and improved.
He usually feels ill about 48 hours after port access for
chemotherapy but it is unclear if this is the chemotherapy or
infection.  The port was placed at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) **]. On Monday,
he had his port accessed for labs and he began to feel like he
was "coming down with a cold" on tuesday afternoon. He went to
work today and around noon felt weak, developed abdominal pain
radiating to his left shoulder, one episode of vomiting and low
grade temp to 99. He went to the ED where his temp rose to 102.9
and he experienced rigors. He denies headache, meningismus, cp,
sob, cough, change in abd pain from baseline, diarrhea, change
in bowel habits, dysuria, rash, joint pain, hematochezia or
melena. No sick contacts. Traveled to [**State **] this weekend for
a conference but was only in hotels/airport. No hiking or
outdoor activities. Of note, his labs on monday for tumor lysis,
lfts were normal and crit was 34 per patient.
.
In the ED, vs were: 99.4 111 117/70 16 96% RA initially. Mild
epigastric tenderness. Guaic negative stool. Prostate exam
normal. UA negative. He received 4 liters IVF. CXR negative. HR
130s. EKG showed sinus tacchycardia. Received lovenox for ? PE
since he couldnt get CTA because of contrast allergy.  Temp rose
to 102.8, gave tylenol. Received vanc and levaquin. Shortly
after receiving the abx, his lips swelled and he developed
hives. He received benadryl and pepcid and this resolved. He has
received those antibiotics multiple times in the past and has
never had a reaction. Of note, per wife, the vanco was given
slowly so red man syndrome less likely.
.
In the ICU, initial vs were: 99.6 103 125/78 90 20 93% RA.
Patient reported feeling better. Denied ha, dizziness, cp, palp,
sob, cough, abd pain, nausea, etc.

Pertinent Results:
.
[**2117-10-8**] MRI Abdomen
FINDINGS: The patient is status post Whipple with expected
postoperative
anatomy and anastomoses. There is expected pneumobilia. In
addition, there
is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, preferentially
within the left system, and also involving the posterior right
biliary duct which arises from the left system, an anatomic
variant. The pre-contrast study demonstrates even more prominent
left ductal dilation. There are equivocal areas of stenosis in
the peripheral left system without evidence of central stenosis,
although the evaluation of stenosis is limited by the presence
of pneumobilia. In the left lobe of the liver, there is subtle
hyperemia in the arterial phase without evidence of abnormality
in signal on the T2-weighted images suggestive of edema. No
enhancing liver lesions are identified. The gallbladder is
surgically absent. Nodularity of the right adrenal gland is
stable compared to the preoperative study. The left adrenal
gland and spleen appear unremarkable. The pancreatic parenchyma
enhances homogeneously. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. The
kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without
hydronephrosis. There are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts.
There is mild perinephric fluid bilaterally, right greater than
left. There is mild thickening of the right lateral conal fascia
which is probably postoperative. Small foci of blooming artifact
on the gradient-echo sequences within the mesentery near the
area of surgery are likely related to hemosiderin and
postoperative change. No evidence of new mass or lymphadenopathy
is appreciated. The signal within the bone marrow appeared to be
normal limits. The lung bases demonstrate small bilateral
pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, right greater than
left.
IMPRESSION:
1. Subtle hyperemia in the left lobe of the liver without
evidence of edema, fluid collection, or central biliary
stenosis. Equivocal stenosis in the periphery of the left
biliary system is difficult to evaluate given the presence of
pneumobilia. Findings could represent subclinical cholangitis,
given biliary anastomoses.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left,
with
associated atelectasis.
3. Stable nodularity in the right adrenal gland, unchanged from
preoperative study.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer who
presents with fever and tachycardia.

# Fever: Patient with fever to 102 and leukocytosis. This is
most likely an infectious in etiology. The differential includes
portacath infection given recent manipulation and timing of the
onset.  The port was last accessed on monday. Blood cultures
drawn peripherally but not from port. The patient also report
abdominal pain and has h/o abdominal abscess, but patient has
had pain at baseline. CXR today showed haziness in R lower base
concerning for early pna vs pulmonary edema.   UA negative
making pna and UTI unlikely.  Pt has elevated liver enzymes that
were normal on monday per patient. Could be elevated in setting
of sepsis. No change in bowel habit, no signs of menigitis, no
murmur on exam to suggest endocarditis. Tick borne disease
unlikely as pt does not have any pets and does not do outdoor
activities at all. No new drugs to suggest drug fever. Empiric
broad spectrum antibiotics for possible line
infection/intrabdominal process: linezolid, cefepime and flagyl
given possible allergy to vanc and levaquin? MRI of abdomen was
performed and found no intrabdominal abscess but subclinic
cholangisit. ID was consulted and thought it was ok to discharge
him on PO Augmetin for one week to follow up with primary
providers.
.
# Tacchycardia: Patient's HR was consistently 110-120s here.
Patient's ekg was c/w sinus tacchycardia. He is mildly fluid
responsive. This could be due to sepsis as above.  Pt high risk
for PE given onc hx, but no other signs of PE. Not anemic,
anxious or in pain. His BB was held.
.
# H/O SVT, currently sinus tacchycardia on ekg. Held metoprolol
given patient is febrile and may be peri-septic. Held BB at
discharge per patient request.
.
# ARF: likely prerenal in setting of possible sepsis
.
# Transaminitis: likely related to volume depletion and sepsis.
Since lfts were normal 2 days ago, liver abscess unlikely. Tbili
normal. Trended down.
.
# Anemia: crit at baseline to slightly higher. He is most likely
hemoconcentrated.
.
# Pancreatic cancer: defer to primary onc team
.
# Restless leg: cont mirapex
.
# HTN: hold lopressor
.
# GERD: cont prilosec
.
# General Care:  replete lytes prn, IVF boluses prn MAP < 65,
npo given possible port removal in am, Access : portacath , one
