BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69 year-old female with past medical
history of coronary artery disease status post MI with stent
to RCA in [**2165**] presents from outside hospital after ruling in
for myocardial infarction.  The patient transferred here for
cardiac catheterization.

1.  Cardiac -  Coronaries the patient with known disease,
increased Troponin and index at outside hospital with EKG
changes all suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.  At
presentation the patient was chest pain free times three
days.  The patient was originally continued on Heparin,
Aggrastat, beta blocker, aspirin, statin and Gemfibrozil.
Plendil was discontinued in favor of starting an Ace
inhibitor.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2171-4-16**] and
this showed one  vessel coronary artery disease. The patient
underwent successful stenting of 95% mid RCA stenosis.  Ejection
fraction was preserved.  The patient suffered from no flow
phenomenon requiring Diltiazem and Nitroglycerin secondary to
chest pain and ST elevations with stent deployment. The patient
also suffered complete heart block secondary to Diltiazem in cath
lab requiring transient pacer.  The patient was transferred
to the CCU with chest pain and persistent ST elevations.
Aggrastat was stopped prior to catheterization secondary to
epistasis and guaiac positive stools.

In the cath lab the patient stabilized on Nitro drip.
Complete heart block resolved and pacing wire was taken out.
The patient was transferred to the floor without chest pain
and with complete resolution of EKG changes to continue
medical management.

The patient had no further episodes of chest pain throughout
her hospital stay.  The patient's Ace inhibitor was changed
to Lisinopril for two day dosing.  The patient continued on
Gemfibrozil and Fluvastatin for cholesterol and was to
complete a 30 day course of Plavix.  Estimated ejection
fraction at cardiac catheterization was 60%.

2.  Hematocrit - The patient with a hematocrit drop peri
catheterization thought to be secondary to anticoagulation.
The patient received three units of packed red blood cells.
The patient hematocrit low was 26.[**4-22**].  ON day of
discharge [**2171-4-21**] the patient's hematocrit bumped to
39.1.

3.  Infectious Disease - The patient had a temperature spike
to 101.2 F the evening of [**4-18**].  The patient was started
on Bactrim for mildly positive urinalysis which consisted of
large blood, small leukocytes, negative nitrites, 5 whites,
moderate bacteria, one squamous epithelial cell.  The patient
had received temporary Foley catheter in the CCU and
complained of mild urinary burning after its being taken out.

The patient defervesced over the next few days but had a low
grade temperature on the evening of [**2171-4-19**]. The patient was
changed to Ciprofloxacin and chest x-ray was unrevealing.
Blood cultures were drawn which showed no growth to date at
the time of discharge.

The patient to be followed as an outpatient and instructed
to take her temperature and if over 100 to seek medical
attention. The patient to complete a seven day course for UTI.
Urine culture was uninterpretable due to fecal contamination.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient to follow up with PCP next
week as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] for primary cardiologist.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  UTI.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 25 milligrams po q day.
2.  Aspirin 325 milligrams po q day.
3.  Lisinopril 20 milligrams po q day.
4.  Gemfibrozil 600 milligrams po bid.
5.  Protonix 40 milligrams po q day.
6.  Fluvastatin 20  milligrams po q day.
7.  Plavix 75 milligrams po q day times 28 days.
8.  Ciprofloxacin 250 milligrams po bid times six days.
