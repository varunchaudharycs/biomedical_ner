Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32993**] was admitted from an OSH on [**2163-4-20**] pre-op for
CABG.  Because of his severe 3VD he was started on heparin and
nitroglycerine drips for optimal control of his CAD.  He
underwent pre-op workup including pre-op head CT (with hx of
CVA) and carotid ultrasound.
On [**2163-4-22**] he proceeded to the OR and underwent a CABG x 3 with
LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the OM, and SVG to the Ramus with patch
angioplasty and repair of ramus posterior rupture (subacute).
Please see OP note for full details.
He was successfully weened and extubated on his operative
evening.
On POD one he remained in the ICU for ongoing hemodynamic
monitoring and on POD two he was transferred to the in-patient
telemetry floor for ongoing care.
In the early morning hours on POD three, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32994**] was
found to be talking non-sensically and trying to get out of bed.
 A neuro consult, head CT and MRI were obtained for suspected
acute CVA.  He was found to have small right parietal, left
cerebellar, and right cerebellar infarcts thought to be embolic
with new post-operative atrial fibrillation.
Over PODs four and five Mr. [**Known lastname 32993**] continued to wax and
waine; he was continued on his heparin and coumadin per neuro
recs.
On POD six his mental status was noted to be significantly
improved with neuro recs only for ongoing anticoagulation for
stroke prevention.
Also on POD six he was noted to have new sternal drainage.  His
WBC bumped up to 18 (from 13) for which he was pan-cultured.  He
had continued bursts of atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone.
On POD seven his sternal drainage significantly increased; due
to his elevated INR, he was unable to return immediately to the
OR.  On POD nine ([**5-2**]) his INR fell below 1.7 and he returned
to the OR for sternal rewiring.
On POD eleven he was found to be C. diff positive with multiple
loose stools and on POD thirteen he was noted to have guaiac
positive stools.  An endoscopy showed bleeding ulcers in the
duodenal bulb accounting for the patient's GIB and hemostasis
was obtained.  He was started on IV protonix with serial Hcts to
monitor progress.  He was transfused as necessary and was taken
off of his anticoagulation.  After two days in the ICU for close
hemodynamic monitoring in light of GIB, he was again transferred
to the inpatient floor on PODs 16 and 5.
He continued to work with the physical therapy team throughout
his stay but it was not felt that he was safe for home.  He was
screened for rehabilitation.
On PODs 20 and 9, a new rash was noted on trunk and Mr.
[**Known lastname 32995**] antibiotics were discontinued.  The rash resolved
and on PODs 24 and 13, it was decided that he was safe for
transfer to a rehabilitation facility for ongoing management,
treatment, and rehabilitation.
Final recommendations from the neurology service are for
coumadin as soon as cleared by GI with 325 mg aspirin daily
until then; to follow-up with primary neurologist.  GI
recommends re-starting Coumadin 14 days post bleed: [**2163-5-10**].
Start coumadin at low dose and keep INR at low-end of
theraupetic.
