History of Present Illness:
55 y/o M with history of liver cirrhosis presents s/p 1 day
of headache and unsteady gait per friend presents to OSH. Per
OSH
reports, patient was seen in ED where he seized 3 times and was
found to have L SDH on CT scan of head. He was loaded with
dilantin and intubated, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and management. Patient is sedated on propofol with a
platelet count of 48 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **].

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2128-4-24**]
1. Bilateral subdural hematomas, as above, left greater than
right, with
stable rightward shift and subfalcine and mild/early uncal
herniation.
2. Possible retained foreign body in left frontotemporal soft
tissues, please correlate clinically.
3. Comminuted nasal fractures, likely chronic.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2128-4-25**]
1. Post-left subdural evacuation changes, with improved moderate
left
pneumocephalus and overlying subcutaneous emphysema.
2. Unchanged blood layering along the tentorial leaflets.
3. Improved rightward subfalcine herniation.
4. No new hemorrhage or mass effect.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o M with hepatitis C andl iver cirrhosis presents to OSH
after 1 day of headachae and unsteadiness. Head CT revealed L
SDH with midline shift. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
neurosurgical intervention. His platelet count at the OSH was
48, repeat head CT showed no increase in hemorrhage, he was
taken emergently to the OR for a L craniotomy for evacuation of
L SDH. OR was uncomplicated and patient was transferred to the
ICU for monitoring overnight. Post op head CT showed
pneumocephalus with good evacuation of blood. On post op
examination, he localized bilateral upper extremities and moved
BLE spontaneously. On [**4-26**], patient was slightly lethargic, but
alert and moving all extremities to commands. He was transferred
to step down unit. He remained stable overnight but he also
remained hyponatremic. A repeat sodium was 135 after being
started on salt tabs.  A repeat urinalysis was also checked to
evaluate the UTI that was treated in the emergency room which
was essentially negative.

On the evening of [**2128-4-27**], patient bacame hypotensive and
required aggressive crystalloid resuscitation.   He responded
reasonably but continued to have hypotension in the AM [**4-28**].  He
required several boluses of IVFs.  NGT was placed in routine
fashion and a CXR confirmed placement in the bowel. Cardiac
enzymes and ECG was obtained to rule out cardiac etiology for
persistent hypotension.  In addition, medicine was consulted for
further recommendations and assistance in management of
hypotension.  CK was elevated at 1028.  ECG showed low voltage
and thus TTE was recommended by medicine as well as urine
studies to rule out rhabdomyolysis.

Required ventilation support for hypoxia.  Continued to become
progressively more hypotensive despite multiple vasopressors.
Decision made by HCP to withdraw treatment and make patient CMO.
