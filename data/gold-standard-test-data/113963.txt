History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yr old woman with h/o HTN, DM, CHF on
digoxin, Afib on coumadin, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] for
altered mental status. Pt was last seen acting normally at
4:30pm, at which time she reported feeling dizzy and went to lay
down. Around 7pm, she was found by her husband laying on her
right side, moaning and unresponsive. No tremors or bladder or
bowel incontinence noted. She was brought by EMS into the OSH ED
for evaluation. There she was reportedly nonverbal but combative
and received ativan 2mg IV x 2. CT head was negative for
intracranial hemorrhage. CXR was significant for a RLQ pneumonia
and pt was given levofloxacin 750mg IV. A digoxin level was
checked which was elevated to 2.8; K was 5.7. She was given 2
vials of digibind and intubated under succinylcholine with
propofol for sedation prior to transport for airway protection
due to diminished gag reflex in the setting of altered mental
status. ABG 7.4/41/111 on AC 500/12/70%/5.

In our ED, VS: T 97.3, HR 41, BP 154/49, O2sat 99% on AC at TV
500, rate 14, PEEP 5, and FiO2 100%. Her CXR showed a sizeable
RML infiltrate, and vanco dose given with 500cc NS. EKG showed
HR in low 40s. 3 vials of digibind drawn up. Toxicology was
consulted and recommended holding further digibind at this time
unless pt drops blood pressure as may overcompensate and affect
her baseline therapeutic level of digoxin. She was transferred
to MICU for monitoring.

On the MICU floor, pt report is intubated and sedated. Per her
husband, she had no fevers, chills, cough, or shortness of
breath suggestive of pneumonia; no choking or coughing with po
intake; no recent sick contacts or hospitalizations. Pt eats
small meals throughout day; husband did not note any recent
change in po intake. She did not complain of any vision changes,
N/V, abd pain, diarrhea, headache, confusion, or hallucinations.
Of note, was seen in Cardiology clinic the day prior with
discontinuation of propanalol and clonidine.

 KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT Study Date of [**2142-7-22**] 2:46 PM
The bones are diffusely demineralized. Degenerative changes are
present predominantly in the medial compartment where there is
joint space
narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Minimal osteophyte
formation is also
noted in the patellofemoral compartment. No discrete fracture is
evident and there is no evidence of dislocation. An equivocal
small suprapatellar joint effusion is demonstrated as well as
extensive vascular calcifications within the soft tissues.

1:09 AM
1. No PE.
2. Diffuse septal thickening, small bilateral pleural effusions,

cardiomegaly, and ground-glass opacities in the dependent
portion of the upper and lower lobes. The constellation of
findings is most compatible with CHF.
3. Subcentimeter hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid,
for which
further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed on a
non-emergent basis.

  TTE (Complete) Done [**2142-7-25**] at 1:51:57 PM      FINAL
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
septum and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well
(LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending aorta and arch are normal in
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is a no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with PMH of atrial fibrillation admitted with
confusion and found to have digoxin toxicity, pneumonia and
acute renal failure.

# Digoxin toxicity: Digoxin levels elevated in toxic range with
bradycardia and PR prolongation.  Likely in setting of
hyperkalemia from acute renal failure from dehydration, possibly
secondary to pneumonia. No recent medication changes other than
discontinuation of propanolol and clonidine, which do not affect
the metabolization of digoxin. Patient was monitored on
telemetry with frequent EKGs and labs for hyperkalemia. Her EKGs
remained stable. She remained hemodynamically stable with
gradually improving HRs. Toxicology was consulted and
recommended holding off on digibind unless HD unstable or EKGs
worsened. This did not occur and no further digibind was given.
Digoxin was 1.0 on [**7-24**] and mental status resolved to baseline.
Will defer to outpatient provider regarding restarting digoxin.
Once bradycardia resolved patient was restarted on Metoprolol
without any unstable hemodynamics.

#Hypoxemia. The patients oxygen requirements increased to using
a non-rebreather mask on [**7-23**]. It is likely that this was due to
CHF exacerbation (supported by BNP > [**Numeric Identifier 389**] and findings on CT)
as furosemide was being held vs effusions present on CT likely
secondary to the pneumonia. PE was initially considered and
ruled out by CT angiogram. The patient was gradually diuresed
and her respiratory status improved, though this was also likely
contributed to by treatment of pneumonia.  Discharged on
2-3L/min NC with stable oxygen status to be weaned at nursing
facility.

# Altered Mental Status: Likely [**3-5**] digoxin toxicity although
may also have delirium in setting of infection. Was intubated at
OSH for airway protection, however, after bronchoscopy here (See
below) she was extubated without difficulty. CXR notable for
large right middle lobe infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
Less likely neuro process; no h/o of seizures, CT head negative
for acute changes. Digoxin toxicity and pneumonia were treated
as described elsewhere and mental status improved to baseline.

# Pneumonia: Large RML (right middle lobe) infiltrate and
leukocytosis suggestive of infectious process although patient
was afebrile and asymptomatic per husband. [**Name (NI) **] likely
ventilator-acquired pneumonia vs aspiration from altered mental
status. Received levofloxacin and vanco prior to arrival on
floor. In setting of digoxin toxicity concern for QT
prolongation, she was changed to Azithromycin/Clindamycin due to
a PCN allergy. After legionella antigen returned negative,
azithro was discontinued. She underwent bronchoscopy and
cultures which grew oropharyngeal flora. Blood cultures were
negative. On [**7-21**], she spiked a fever and antibiotics were
changed to ceftriaxone. She again spiked on [**7-23**] and coverage
broadened by changing antibiotics to cefipime and vancomycin.
She should complete a 8 day course for ventilator associate
pneumonia. Vancomycin is being dosed Q24 hours for renal
insufficiency but will be monitored at her nursing facility
should her renal function improve.

# Acute renal failure: Cr elevated above baseline here 1 year
ago of 0.9. BUN/Cr ratio suggested prerenal etiology, likely in
setting of pneumonia. Creatinine improved with IVF. Renally
dosed meds. Held ACE-I. On [**7-23**], the patient was found to have
increased oxygen requirments and was placed on a non-rebreather
mask. In the setting of respiratory distress and concern for PE
vs decompensated heart failure, the risks of renal insult were
outweighed by the need for CT-angio with IV contrast and
diuresis. Pt received N-acetylcysteine course and cautious fluid
resusitation.  Upon discharge, Cr 1.3 and Lisinopril continuing
to be held with possible restart at her nursing facility.

# CHF - acute on chronic, systolic: Prior TTEs not in system; EF
unknown prior to admission but appeared dry here when first
admitted and received gentle IVF. Held lasix in setting of
dehydration. Also initially held beta blocker and ACE inhibitor
as PR prolongation and ARF.  When patient developed new O2
requirment, Lasix was restarted for diuresis.  TTE obtained at
that time revealed AS and EF = 30-35%.  Continued to hold ACE
inhibitor for hospitalization but beta blocker was restarted and
patient was continued on statin, fish oil and ASA.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Held digoxin, metoprolol and amiodarone
in setting of digoxin toxicity as did not want to contribute to
nodal blockade given bradycardia. INR was supratherapeutic on
admission and coumadin was held. Warfarin restarted on [**7-22**] and
INR has been therapeutic. Metoprolol was restarted and she
remained rate controlled during the rest of her admission.
Amiodarone and Digoxin were not restarted.

# Hypertension: Held metoprolol and lisinopril as above.
Continued amlodipine for BP control. Restarted metoprolol, but
contiue to hold lisinopril for ARF.

#Aortic stenosis: classified as severe on echocardiogram.
Diuresed gently as patient was preload-dependent. Remained
hemodynamically stable. Advised to manage as outpatient

# Swollen righ knee: Seen by rheumatology, whose assessment was
polyarticular gout flare. The joint was aspirated and crystals
were noted by Rheum fellow but not in final report. Synovial
fluid with neutrophilic infiltrate. Cultures negative. Acute
gout flare was treated with indomethacin and colchicine.
Indomethacin was discontinued the following day given ARF.  The
patinet improved and has not complained of joint pain since
[**7-24**]. Colchicine discontinued on [**7-27**]. Continued home dose of
Allopurinol.

# Urinary incontinence: Detrol and oxybutynin were discontinued
on suspicion that they might contribute to AMS. The patient now
reports feeling that she is able to adequately control her
bladder, and we will defer to outpatient provider regarding
these medications.

# History of TIA: No evidence of bleed on OSH CT head. Continued
ASA. Therapeutic on warfarin and statin therapy.

# Hypothyroid - elevated TSH, T3 low. Patient without clinical
signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Difficult to evaluate
laboratory abnormalities in setting of acute illness and will
defer treatment for now and recommend evaluation by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
supplemental medication started.

# Thyroid hypodensity: Noted on imaging as described above.
This should be followed by PCP for further evaluation and
management post-discharge.

#Diabetes mellitus type 2. Managed on sliding scale insulin with
basal glarigne while holding Metformin. Started home medication
metformin the day of discharge as patient was 72 hours after her
contrast load.  Additionally, should patient Cr worsen to > 1.5
would stop as will poorly cleared.
