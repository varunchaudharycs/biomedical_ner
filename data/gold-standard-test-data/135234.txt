Chief Complaint:
chest pain, lactic acidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100424**] is a 78 year old gentleman with metastatic NSCLC
admitted for elevated lactate. The patient presented to
Radiation Oncology today for WBXRT (session [**5-3**] today), and
while at clinic developed 2-3 minutes of chest pain described as
sternal chest pressure rated as [**4-29**] that resolved with
supplemental oxygen.  The patient denied any associated SOB,
n/v, palpitations, pain radiating to jaw, arm, or back that
resolved with supplmental oxygen.  He was then sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 97.9 143/89 68 16 100%RA. The patient
received vanco and levofloxacin over concern for pneumonia as
well as 3L IVF with an increase in his lactate from 4.1 to 4.7.
A CTA was negative for PE, but demonstrated diffuse ground glass
opacities, right base consolidation, and persistent infiltrates
largely unchanged from a recent PET-CT. The patient was then
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.
.
On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was resting comfortably
without complaints. Denies any f/c/s, n/v/d, CP/SOB,
palpitations, cough, orthopnea, PND, or hemoptysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100424**] is a 78 year old gentleman with stage IV NSCLC
admitted for lactic acidosis.
.
# Lactic acidosis: Anion gap of 15 on admission. During recent
admission ([**6-28**]), no lactate was measured although AG ranged
from [**1-2**] and bicarb 24-26 during admission with albumin >4.
Differential includes type A lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion)
from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS
versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or active
malignancy.  No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic
function to suggest inability to clear lactate.  While in the
ICU, the patient's metformin was held, venous lactate levels and
anion gap were followed.  He received maintenence fluids.  His
lactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor.
.
# Chest pain/CAD: Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED
unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities. CTA negative for PE
and patient was CP free throughout his stay in the ICU.  His
home meds including ASA, statin, lisinopril, and nadolol were
continued.
.
# Leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, WBC and fever
curve were stable in ICU.
.
# Lung CA: Per primary oncologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], Decadron was
continued.  The patient received whole brain XRT while in the
ICU, with plans to receive another dose the day after ICU
discharge
.
# Ground glass opacities: Patchy ground glass opacities on CT
present in 6/[**2174**].  Given heteregenous nature, unlikely to be
edema.  Less likely to be blood, and low likelihood given
clinical presentation for bacterial infection.  Given recent
dexamethasone therapy, concern for PCP given lack of
prophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiation
of dexamethasone makes this less likely.  Pt was started on PCP
prophylaxis with Bactrim
.
# COPD: Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol were continued.
.
# HTN: Home regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril was continued.
.
# Diabetes, type 2: Metformin given lactic acidosis and contrast
load, pt was covered with ISS with accuchecks.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued, ezetimibe held
given lack of data regarding benefit.
.
# GERD: PPI Continued

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you were found in clinic to be short
of breath with chest pain. A heart related cause was ruled out
with testing, however another test showed that you had too much
lactic acid. This is usually a seroius sign that your body is
not getting enough oxygen. Thus, you spent a night in the ICU.
It was discovered also that your blood sugar was far too high.
Accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolled
diabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it. We
followed your labs and you gradually improved. At the same time,
you were able to receive radiation therapy.
.
You were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen:
NEW Lantus 20 units in the morning
NEW Glypizide 5 mg twice a day
NEW Bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroids
STOP Metformin
HOLD Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin
(such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor.
Your sugars are elevated due to your steroids - once your
steroids are decreased this diabetes regimen will need to be
adjusted. Therefore it is very important to follow-up with your
primary care doctor. Call your primary care doctor, [**Doctor Last Name **],[**Doctor Last Name **]
S. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14148**], for an appointment in [**1-21**] weeks for diabetes
management. Take your blood sugar as directed by your primary
doctor. If you have low blood sugar drink apple juice and
crackers and call your primary care doctor.
.
Return to the hospital if you have chest pain, high fevers,
dizziness, weakness or any other symptoms that concern you.
.
Call your primary care doctor, [**Doctor Last Name **],[**Doctor Last Name **] S. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14148**], for
an appointment in [**1-21**] weeks for diabetes management.
