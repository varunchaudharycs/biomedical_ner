Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
63F with multiple medical problems and multiple admissions for
altered mental status presenting with abdominal pain and altered
mental status. Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] exploratory laparotomy on
[**2122-9-11**] and was found to have benign cecal pneumatosis.  The
patient presents now for progressive confusion and decreased
mental acuity.  The family is not available to discuss their
concerns and the patient complains of unchanged abdominal pain.


In the ED her vitals were 98.2 99 123/39 17 99%RA. FSG was 86 on
arrival. Exam showed A+O x 1. Labs were c/w ESRD, with AG
acidosis, but no hyperkalemia. Neurology was consulted given the
AMS, and felt it was due to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and
not a central insult or seizure. CXR was unrevealing except for
LLL atelectasis. No urine able to be obtained but blood cultures
were sent. A CT head was negative. A CT abdomen and pelvis was
obtained which showed no acute process or abscess, but a small
hematoma/stranding in the anterior subcutaneous tissues and
likely also left rectus, c/w recent surgery. Her HR did increase
to the 140s in the ED, responded to IV labetolol, but pressure
dropped. This responded to IVF. She was given 250mg of
levetiracetam and admitted to medicine for further workup of AMS
and correction of electrolytes.

there were bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing
suggestive of
midline subcortical dysfunction. Nonetheless, there were no

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Altered mental status/seizure/intubation: most likely
etiology is multiple missed hemodialysis sessions/uremia. It is
possible the Tylenol with codeine she was taking for post
operative pain control contributed.  The morning following
admission she had an episode of decreased responsiveness, clonic
jerks, lip smacking and hand automatisms. She was evaluated by
neurology and was given Ativan and Depakote for complex partial
seizure. Approximately 1 hour after this she became unresponsive
and her tongue was swollen.  She was intubated for airway
protection due to angioedema. Her mental status normalized
(thought to be related to post-ictal state and medications), EEG
was negative for status epilepticus, head CT and toxicology
screens were negative.  The patient required daily dialysis from
[**Date range (3) 45315**] and her mental status normalized and was stable
for several days at discharge.

2. Angioedema/respiratory failure: Her tongue was noted to be
swollen prior to the administration of Depakote during
suctioning prior to intubation.  The angioedema seemed to
correlate with the Ativan administration. There is a report of
angioedema in the past, attributed to Dilantin--but she received
Ativan at that time as well.  She was treated for 24 hours with
steroids with remarkable improvement.  Her lisinopril was also
discontinued.  Her intubation was for airway protection in the
setting of altered mental status and angioedema. She had
persistent apneic episodes on the ventilator and never developed
a cuff leak. She has presumed tracheal stenosis from prior
tracheostomy.  She was successfully extubated in the presence of
anesthesia on [**2122-9-25**].  It is recommended she have an outpatient
sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea as well as
an outpatient allergy evaluation.

3. Seizures: The patient suffered a partial complex seizure on
the morning after admission.  The neurology team followed the
patient throughout her admission.
She was initially loaded with depakote, however, this was then
tapered off and her [**Date Range 13401**] dosing was increased to 500 mg twice
daily and an additional dose following hemodialysis. She will
follow up with Neurology as an outpatient.

4. ESRD on HD: She missed two outpatient HD sessions prior to
admission.  She was dialyzed daily in the MICU from [**Date range (1) 45316**]
then returned to her scheduled of T/T/Saturday.

5. Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with metoprolol. She had a
single episode of RVR in the ED prior to admission which
responded to labetalol, otherwise, she was effectively rate
controlled.  Her INR was subtherapeutic at admission, but was
therapeutic at discharge.  Her INR will need to be followed in
rehabilitation and outpatient monitoring set up prior to
discharge home.

6. Abdominal Pain: likely post operative, waxed and waned on
this admission.  At the time of discharge, the pain was
controlled by Tylenol.  Her staples were removed by the surgical
team during this hospitalization.  She had increased discharge
from her abdominal wound noted on [**2122-9-28**]. The surgery team
evaluated and felt the wound was healing well and there was no
evidence of a wound infection. They recommended daily dry
dressing changes.

7. Benign Hypertension: continued on amlodipine and metoprolol.
Lisinopril discontinued in the setting of angioedema and not
restarted. The amlodipine was started in its place. Her blood
pressure ranged 110-140s/50-70s prior to discharge.

8. Disposition: the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.  She will benefit from a home safety evaluation and
visiting nurses to evaluate medication understanding/compliance.
She requires INR monitoring.  As an outpatient, she should have
an allergy evaluation for the recurrent angioedema as well as a
sleep study to evaluate sleep apnea.
