History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 28M well-known to the West 2 surgical service. He
was discharged [**2146-3-9**] after a prolonged hospital course for
gallstone pancreatitis. This was complicated by DVT,
respiratory/renal failure requiring mechanical ventillatory
support and CVVHD, and pancreatic necrosis requiring
percutaneous drainage. He improved and was discharged yesterday
to a rehabilitation facility. Today, he returns with tachycardia
and increased abdominal pain. The patient states that he began
to experience abdominal pain yesterday afternoon while working
with PT. He states that this pain is similar to the epigastric
pain he has experienced all along only worse. He rated this as
an [**9-6**] though currently [**7-7**]. He states that he was able to eat
dinner (grilled chicken) without difficulty. He was eating
breakfast this morning and became nauseated while eating grapes.
He had several episodes of non-bilious emesis and was brought to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care given increased abdominal pain and
tachycardia.

Prior to Discharge:
[**2146-4-27**] PT/INR: 31.9/3.2
.
IMAGING:
[**2146-3-10**] AP CXR: Low lung volumes with LLL consolidation, could
reflect atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**2146-3-10**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Minimal interval increase in size of right upper quadrant
pancreatic pseudocyst. Interval decrease in size of remaining
loculated fluid collections.
2. No pulmonary embolism present. Large bilateral pleural
effusions with associated compression atelectasis.
3. Increased amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid.
.
[**2146-3-11**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS:
1. Persistent non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral
vein.
2. No right lower extremity DVT.
3. Small right popliteal cyst.
.
[**2146-3-15**] CXR:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no
change in extremely low lung volumes and bilateral pleural
effusions, left more than right. There is mild prominence of the
vasculature that appears to be more pronounced than on the prior
study and might represent some degree of volume overload. The
right internal jugular line tip appears to be atleast at the
cavoatrial junction, but also may be present in the proximal
right atrium.
.
[**2146-3-16**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Enlargement of the previously seen fluid collection and
appearance of the numerous new large collections in the
peritoneum. The drained collection has significantly decreased
in size.
2. Increase in pleural effusions: Left moderate and right
minimal size, findings are accompanied by compressive
atelectasis.
3. Minimal residual of the left common femoral vein and left
external iliac vein thrombus.
.
[**2146-3-17**] AP CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**3-15**], there is still extremely
low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base is
consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm
suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung is
essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
congestion. The tip of the right IJ catheter is difficult to see
but appears to be in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
.
1. Markedly decreased size of drained collection anterior to the
stomach and surroiunding the left hepatic lobe. New extensive
stranding and fluid within the gastrohepatic ligament and porta
hepatis, possibly induced by leakage from one of the adjacent
collections or recurrent pancreatitis. Slight re-accumulation of
fluid within the previously drained collection in the anterior
abdomen, now measuring 14.3 x 1.6 x 5.4 cm. Otherwise, overall
decrease in multiple remaining peritoneal and extraperitoneal
fluid collections compared to the prior study.
2. Persistent bile duct dilation likely secondary to
pancreatitis. Increased attenuation of patent portal vein from
adjacent new inflammation. Persistent marked attenuation of the
splenic vein. Smaller splenic infarcts.
3. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and associated
compressive atelectasis.
4. Unchanged thrombus within the left external iliac and common
iliac veins.
.
[**2146-3-28**] CXR:
Stable size of left pleural effusion with associated
consolidation which likely represents atelectasis but
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
.
[**2146-4-13**] ABD/PELVI CT W/CONTRAST:
1. In this patient with known history of necrotizing
pancreatitis, there is enhancement of the distal body and tail
of the pancreas with non visualization of the remainder of the
pancreas. Multiple extensive peripancreatic fluid collections
have decreased in size since the prior study.
2. A small fluid collection adjacent to the inferior edge of
right lobe of liver measuring 4.9 x 3.2 x 2.0 cm, is new since
the prior study.
3. Unchanged left femoral vein thrombosis. Infrarenal IVC filter
in place.
4. Mild interval improvement in the small-to-moderate left
pleural effusion.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower
lobe is unchanged.
.
[**2146-4-15**] CXR:
Status after withdrawal of a left-sided chest tube. Minimal
apical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of
tension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No
other changes. Normal cardiac silhouette.
.
[**2146-4-18**] CXR:
1. Low lung volumes with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis,
likely related to the recent abdominal surgery and ongoing
intra-abdominal process.
2. No appreciable residual left pneumothorax.
3. Left-sided PICC likely at the junction of that axillary and
subclavian vein; this may need to be advanced into a more
central vein, depending on the indication for its use.
.
[**2146-4-20**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST:
1. Slightly decreased size of dominant central abdominal fluid
collection with left drain in satisfactory position. Right
catheter has been removed.
2. Other fluid collections are little changed [**2146-4-13**].
3. Resolving left pleural effusion with pleural air secondary to
left thoracic drain placement and removal. No new peripancreatic
fluid collection.
4. Hypodensity of the blood pool relative to the ventricular
myocardium is suggestive of anemia.
5. Moderate biliary dilatation likely secondary to CBD
obstruction by pseudocyst is similar to [**2146-4-13**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was re-admitted on [**2146-3-10**] back to the General
Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain
and tachycardia.  Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed minimal
interval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreatic
pseudocyst, but decrease in size of remaining loculated fluid
collections. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
compression atelectasis were noted, as well as increased amount
of abdominal and pelvic free fluid. He was admitted to the SICU,
made NPO, started on vigorous IV fluid rescusitation, a foley
was placed, and he received IV pain medication with good effect.
He had a very long, and complicated hospital course.
.
In the process of repairing his florid necrotizing pancreatitis
secondary to his history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, he
ultimately developed recurrent pseudocyts, which have plagued
him throughtout his hospital stays since [**48**]/[**2145**]. To date, these
pseudocyts have been managed largely with percutaneous catheter
drainage of the pseudocysts. Initially, during this admission,
this was the approach to managing the patient's recurring
pseudocyts. The patient underwent drainage of pancreatic
pseudocysts on [**2146-3-10**] and [**2146-3-18**], Ultrasound and CT-guided,
respectively. However, he developed an accumulating posterior
retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was
evidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. The
recent drainages of the other satellite lesions have dried them
up. The main retroperitoneal cyst continued to grow in size, and
became symptomatic for him. He was unable to eat full meals and
has a diminished capacity to keep food down, as well as a poor
appetite. He also repeatedly spiked temperatures.
.
Given his history of a left lower extremity acute deep venous
thrombosis, Vascular Surgery was consulted. In lieu of planned
surgical intervention on [**2146-4-5**] for treatment of the above
pseudocyst with adhesions, the patient underwent placement of a
Bard G2 inferior vena cava filter, which went without
complication. Then on [**2146-4-5**], the patient underwent external
drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis,
which also went well without complication (see Operative Note).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was
returned to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN,
with a foley catheter and two JP drains in place (one in the
pseudocyst and one in the abdomen to drain ascites), he was
continued on a Fentanyl patch and was given a Morphine PCA with
good effect. He was hemodynamically stable.
.
NEURO: Upon admission, the patient received IV pain medication
PRN transitioned to a Morphine PCA with good effect and adequate
pain control. When tolerating oral intake, he was transitioned
to oral pain medications. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the
Chronic Pain Service was consulted. His pain was controlled once
the Fentanyl dose was increased to 75mcg/72Hr plus the Morphine
PCA. When again tolerating a diet post-operatively, the PCA was
discontinued, and he was started on oral pain medication in
addition to the Fentanyl patch with continued good effect. He
remained neurologically intact.
.
CV: Upon admission, tachycardia responded to vigorous IV fluid
rescusitation and beta-blockade with Metoprolol 50mg TID.
Metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID with eventual excellent
rate and BP control. By discharge, the Metoprolol was decreased
to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
PULMONARY: Tachypnea on admission. Chest CTA revealed large
bilateral pleural effusions with associated compression
atelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and
supplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the
incentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received
chest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to
wean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still
extremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base
is consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the
hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The
right lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion.

Starting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC
increased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed
which demonstrated a left pleural effusion
on the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted
for management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent
ultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural
pigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain,
cytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail
catheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal
apical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of
tension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A
follow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with
left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the
recent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No
appreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient
remained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.
Respiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent
ambulation was encouraged.
.
GU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received
vigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed.
Allowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on
[**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting
with 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial
overnight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning.
Given persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC
was placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision
to proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When
not NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat
regular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley
catheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without
problem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and
IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
.
GI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.
Shortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided
pseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a
drainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver
and pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up
abdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the
previously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous
new large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection
had significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient
returned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior
collection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.
The previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst
was succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to
gravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an
accumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to
progress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic
remnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic
pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L)
flank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms
improved.
.
ID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture
had no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted
a fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative.
Fluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely
watched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was
negative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal
fluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**]
all grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV
Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a
temperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the
thorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and
Fluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**].
Infectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic
recommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was
discomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**]
with Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent
home on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four
weeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was
administered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin.
.
HEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the
patient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to
fluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**],
FFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a
large anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after
the patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation
of the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4
units of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned
collection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2
units of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further
blood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7.
.
PROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat
duplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent
non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right
DVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission,
Coumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of
the collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin
restarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second
collection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient
was restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to
Coumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was
therapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal
2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**].
.
MOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation
therapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate
independently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without
assistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged
home with VNA and PT services. The patient received discharge
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

.
Coumadin (Warfarin):

What is this medicine used for?

This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not
form.

How does it work?

Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood
to prevent clots from forming.

What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:

Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing;
chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color;
fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe
dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you
hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel
fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically,
severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black,
tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds,
coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,

severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.

Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for
whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems,
vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems

could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.

Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:

Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin.
For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat

while taking this medication.

Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid
foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of
vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However,
recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K
from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your
dietary vitamin K intake.

These foods contain vitamin K:

Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli,
Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,

Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens,
Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver.
Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,

Soybeans and Cashews.

Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage

but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious
problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you
drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual
pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on
special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually
would on any regular day of the week.

Monitoring:

The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by
testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is
clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for
bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for
forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood
test that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring
is called an INR.

Use of Other medications:

When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can
change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also
change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to

talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you
are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics,
vitamins, or herbal products.
