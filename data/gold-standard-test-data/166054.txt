History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16368**] is a 28-year-old man with a history of biclonal
leukemia, diagnosed in [**2169-12-20**] status post chemo initially
and then after a relapse of his ALL, he underwent allo BMT
transplant on [**2170-5-3**], but his ALL relapsed in [**2171-7-21**]
and was treated with vincristine, prednisone, and Gleevec. The
Gleevec was discontinued because of a reaction to it. Most
recently he has received Clofarabine after which he had an
aplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost. His most
recent hospitalization was [**10-23**] until [**2172-3-26**] during which he
was noted to have pulmonary nodules, and was treated empirically
with ambisome, voriconazole, and initially capsofungin and was
sent home on ambisome and voriconazole. Last dose of ambisome
was [**3-31**], and he was continued on voriconazole alone with his
last dose on [**4-16**] because the the medication.

He was last seen in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]??????s clinic on [**2172-4-16**] and had been
doing well. He had a bone marrow biopsy performed on that day as
well. The bone marrow biopsy is pending at this time.
The patient presented to the ED on [**4-19**] at 04:30 complaining of
chest and neck pain. The patient states that he was in his usual
state of good health until last night when he had gradual onset
left neck to substernal chest pain described as "something
squeezing in from my lungs," "pressure," 15/10 and pleurtic. He
also complains of neck pain which is worse with movement. No
associated SOB or diaphoresis. Has had mild nausea since his
discharge without emesis. Patient denies f/c, cough, abdominal
pain, rash. This pain is similar to pulmonary nodule pain he has
had in the past.
In the ED, his initial VS were 99.2, HR 121 BP 126/78 RR 16 100%
on RA. He was given Morphine 8 mg iv and dilaudid 8mg iv for
pain control and became hypotensive with VS 116, 78/44 while in
the ED. He recieved 6 L NS with only 500 cc of dark urine output
over several hours and was then started on Levophed for pressure
support. Seen by cardiology consult who felt not consistent with
cardiogenic shock. He was admitted to the MICU for further work
up and management.


Past Medical History:
1. Biclonal leukemia:
-Diagnosed [**12-23**] -- Presenting with sore throat, severe upper
airway inflammation requiring intubation, and a WBC of 130,000.

Examination of the marrow demonstrated nearly 100%blasts, and
cytogenetic examination showed t9;22 and q341.-q11.2. He was
initially treated with emergent pheresis, steroids, and
hydroxyurea, then was started on regimens to address both ALL
and the AML component. He underwent hyperCVAD regimen without
complete remission.
-[**4-21**] -- Pt had matched unrelated donor allo-BMT with preceding

total body radiation and cytoxan conditioning regimen. Following

this, he exeperienced grade 1 GvHD with rash, treated with
steroid taper. He had a transaminitis at the time, but bx
excluded hepatic GvHD involvement.
-[**Date range (1) 46485**] -- Marrow bx indicated remission
-[**7-23**] -- Pt developed petechiae, WBC found to be 18.4, platelets

of 19, 18%blasts, and a marrow bx indicated ALL recurrence. He
was treated with vincristine and prednisone.
-[**2171-8-29**] -- A repeat marrow bx indicated residual leukemia,
though improved from previous.
-[**2171-9-4**] -- Pt underwent donor lymphocyte infusion
-[**2171-10-14**] -- Marrow biopsy shows leukemia with 80% involvement,

and pt is admitted for hyperCVAD, discharged [**10-17**].
-[**10-23**]- Received Clofarabine after which he had an
aplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost.
2. Prolonged Febrile Neutropenia complicated by severe
infections including probable fungal infection with pulmonary
nodules and mesenteric mass.
3. Transaminitis -- Liver bx with focal pmn aggregates, no
evidence of GvHD [**6-21**].
4. Typhilitis
5. Line infection

girlfriend. Family is supportive. No tobacco use. Previous
occasional etoh use, none currently. No illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: [**4-20**]
There has been interval development of patchy opacification at
the left lung base peripherally. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature remains normal. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. The right-sided central
venous catheter is stable in position.
IMPRESSION:
Interval development of new left-sided patchy opacification,
left lung base. Given the patient's history of ALL, this is
concerning for developing pnemonia.

Chest/Abd/pelvis CT [**2172-4-19**]:
1) Hazy opacity within the right lower lobe, a finding that
could partly related to atelectasis, although is suspicious for
pneumonia given its asymmetry.
2) No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
3) Stable small to moderate pericardial effusion.
4) Decreased size of mesenteric mass, which is now not
measurable, with minimal residual haziness in the mesentery.

Brief Hospital Course:


#Hypotension: Original ddx was early sepsis vs. narcotics
related vs. cardiogenic vs adrenal insufficiency. He required
levophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain SBP>100 and
was started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenal
insufficiency. Pt had flat JVP and warm extremities, no evidence
of tamponade. He was ruled out for MI by enzymes, and cardiology
consult did not not think picture was c/w cardiogenic shock. A
cortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, so
we discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone. Sepsis was
considered and he was broadly covered on admission with
ambisome, imipenem, voriconazole. He was weaned off vasopressors
and IVF on HD3 and SBP's remained in the 90's but he was
asymptomatic, making urine, and had normal lactate so no further
intervention was made.
.
#ID:
a) Pulmonary nodules:
Pt had history of pulmonary nodules thought to be of fungal
origin without positive cultures data. He had been on empiric
treatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3
months, then voriconazole alone since [**4-1**], but was off this for
four days before admission. Chest CT revealed no nodular
infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was
started on levofloxacin. At that same time he was started on
Vancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had a
permanent tunneled line. He developed periorbital edema and
diffuse skin etyhema, elevated LFT's and eosinophilia thought
initially due to vancomycin so this was stopped. Vancomycin was
changed to daptomycin which was stopped [**4-21**] given blood cultures
remained negative x 48 hours. Infectious workup in looking for
source of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture,
fungal , AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], mycoplasma, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**] urine Ag,
galatomannan all of which were negative. Pt's LFT's continued to
rise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed to
azithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of. He was then
started on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence of
fungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD as
below.

Elevated LFT's-Pt continued to have climbing LFT with a
cholestatic picture initially thought to be due to drug reaction
by both ID and dermatology. Skin biopsy showed complete
separation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash.
Alkaline phosphatase continued to rise despite rash improving so
then arose concern for GVHD as had occured in the past. At this
point he was started on cyclosporine dosed to trough >100 and a
day later Mycofenolate was added. Liver team was consulted and
felt this was most likely GVHD and got a liver biopsy. Biopsy
revealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with GVHD
although it was unclear if this was old or new. He was continued
on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling
well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of
elevated LFT's as an outpt.
.
#Chest/Neck pain: T wave changes on EKG were non-diagnostic. It
didn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out for
MI with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry. CTA
showed no PE/aortic dissection. Most likely cause of pain is
pleuritic chest pain from pneumonia. He was treated with his
outpatient dose of oxycontin in hospital which he responded well
to.
.
#Anemia: baseline hct was around 28 thought to be anemia of
chronic diseae.
Hemolysis labs were negative
