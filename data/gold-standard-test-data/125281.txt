Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2648**]
Addendum:
He remained in hospital after discovering that liver abscesses
grew sparse mucor. ID recommended posoconazole in addition to
ambisone. This was started and he continued on this for the
remainder of hospital course. The decision was made to keep him
hospitalized until re-transplanted.
     Psychiatry was consulted for depression. Dextroamphetamine
was recommended as first choice with zoloft being an alternative
[**Doctor Last Name 932**]. Zoloft was started and dose increase during remainder of
hospital stay with some improvement in mood.
     2 units of PRBC were given for a hct of 22 on [**6-4**]. Epogen
was continued. On [**6-5**] an abd ct revealed mod ascites for which
hepatology was consulted. A paracentesis was performed. He was
cultured for a temp of 101.7 on [**6-7**] for which the c-line was
changed. The tip was neg for growth as well as urine and blood.
     On [**6-9**] he grew gram +cocci (VRE-enterococcus faecium)only
sensitive to linezolid. Given past h/o myelosuppression, he was
started on Tigecycline. Tigecycline continued for 16 days. He
spiked a temp on [**6-12**] and again the c-line was changed over a
wire. A rpt ABD CT revealed two fluid collections within the
left and right lobes of the liver. The collection within the
right lobe of the liver appeared to have increased in size,
measuring 5.6 x 4.1 cm. The left liver lobe collection was
essentially unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on
the left, were decreased slightly and a large amount of ascites,
which was decreased slightly. There was evidence of peritoneal
enhancement. The fluid extended into the inguinal canals, and
was loculated on the right side. Ceftriaxone which was used for
E.coli was stopped after 18 days and  Meropenum was started for
E.coli & Strep veridins to broaden coverage. Dapto was stopped.
He remained on meromenum for 38 days. He continued to spike
temps.
     Repeat paracentesis was done on [**6-15**]. Cultures were
negative. On [**6-18**], he was removed from the Transplant list given
multidrug resistant multifocal liver abscesses, poor nutritional
status despite J tube feedings, debilitation and poor prior
outcomes in other patients with similar setting. On [**6-16**] blood
cultures grew yeast. Ambisone was started [**6-19**]. Repeat blood and
drain cultures were sent. A TTE was done to r/o vegetations.
This was negative. An Ophthalmology exam was negative as well.
On [**6-23**] a repeat abd CT revealed two large fluid collections
within the left and right lobes of the liver. The left lobe
fluid collection had decreased in size, whereas the right lobe
fluid collection had increased in size. A large well
circumscribed fluid collection extending down the right inguinal
canal into the right scrotum was seen. A head CT was done to r/o
infection. This was negative.
     On [**6-24**] an 8 Fr catheter was repostitioned in RLQ. Culure of
the fluid grew ENTEROCOCCUS SP,CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.
SPARSE GROWTH, NON-FERMENTER, NOT PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.
[**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.MODERATE GROWTH and CITROBACTER
FREUNDII COMPLEX. Blood cultures from [**6-23**] continued to grow
yeast and VRE. Blood cultures were done q 3 days.  On [**7-1**] CT
findings showed new area of decreased enhancement in segment [**Doctor First Name **]
of the liver, worrisome for a new area of ischemia/infarction.
Internal air bubbles were present, and superinfection of this
area could not be excluded. The area did not appear to have
adequate liquification for percutaneous catheter drainage. Two
collections in left lobe of the liver had appropriately
positioned drainage catheters appeared slightly smaller and a
collection in right lobe of the liver, which contained an
appropriately positioned catheter was unchanged in size. On [**6-30**]
Dapto was restarted as well as gentamycin for synergy to attempt
to clear VRE.
Ambisone was changed to Caspo on [**7-3**]. On [**7-7**],the catheter in
right lobe of liver was advanced several centimeters with
aspiration of approximately 20 cc of purulent material. This
appeared in continuity with multiple bilomas/dilated ducts,
which were slightly more prominent than on the previous study.
ID recommended a TTE to r/o vegetation, but the patient refused
TTE.
     Synercid was started perioperatively for VRE coverage. On
[**7-17**] he was taken to the OR for irrigation and debridement of
hepatic abscess, right lobe by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. 40-50cc of
purulent, bile stained drainage was removed. A large drain was
left in place and placed to suction. He tolerated this procedure
well. Blood cultures and cline tip on [**7-7**] were negative.
Cultures were negative until [**7-14**]. He was relisted for liver
transplantation. Subsequent cultures grew  enterococcus faeceum.
Repeat cultures were negative, but then reculture grew
enterococcus faeceum and presumed torulopsis glabrata (per
ID).Levaquin was added for additional gram negative coverage.
       Repeat Abd CT showed interval placement of JP drain into
the right lobe of the liver with associated focal subcutaneous
air/surgical emphysema. Air containing abscess in the right lobe
superior to this appeared to have increased in size.
Splenomegaly and ascites were again noted. On [**7-21**], he underwent
successful CT-guided pigtail cath placement in enlarging fluid
collection at the junction of segments 8 and 4A.

     On [**7-29**] abd CT revealed 1) S/p multiple drains. Confluent
biloma/abscess involving segment [**Doctor First Name **] and VIII of the liver, the
component in the right lobe is smaller compared to the CT of
[**2122-7-21**].
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Persisting ascites, predominantly left-sided and partially
loculated.
4) Nonvisualized proper hepatic artery, likely occluded. Partial
SMV occlusion.
5) Prominent right-sided hydrocele.
6) Splenomegaly.
     Abscess cultures persistently grew VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **]
(TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA. P.
     On [**7-31**]  Caspofungin and meropenum was stopped. The 2
drains in the left lobe were removed. A repeat CT on [**8-3**]
revealed collection in left lobe and a drain was placed into
this site and 10cc was sent for culture. Results are pending.
     On [**8-6**] the capped PTC drain fell out with no adverse
effects. Developed diarrhea after tube feed formula changed.
Stool was sent for c.diff. Stool neg on [**8-5**] and pending for
[**8-6**]
     On [**8-14**] the right liver abscess catheter fell out. This
area was then loosely packed with normal saline moist gauze [**Hospital1 **].
Potassium was consistently running high. A renal consult was
obtained. Bactrim and synercid were felt to be contributing to
hyperkalemia. Bactrim SS was decreased to 3x/week and the tube
feeding was changed back to 1/2 strength Nepro. Potassium
decreased within the normal range.
     In summary, this hospital course was extremely long and
complicated. He has remained afebrile for last few weeks.
Posoconazole, Levaquin, Synercid will continue. Rifaximin is to
prevent encephalopathy. Bactrim is for pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 2515**]. The plan
is to send [**Doctor First Name **] to [**Hospital **] Rehab Hospital with the hope of
building him up nutritionally and increasing his physical
strength and independence with the hope of keeping him afebrile
while awaiting re-transplantation of a second liver.  He will be
followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Transplant Surgeon) and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**] (ID).
