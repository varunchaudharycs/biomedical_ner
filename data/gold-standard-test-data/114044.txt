Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension and ascites

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Abdominal Paracentesis (8.8 and 8.11)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59304**] is a 46-year-old male with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma now on axitinib therapy for ~5 weeks, admitted
[**Date range (1) 91600**] with anemia, malignant ascites and treated with
3L therapeutic paracentesis 2 wks ago and noted to have disease
progression on CT. Patient presented from cliic with hypotension
(SBP 70s). He had acutely worsening sharp diffuse abdominal pain
that is worse with movement the night prior to admission.  The
morning of admission he felt weak and dizzy.  He had two episoes
of vomiting; one prior to admission which was bilious and one
while in the ED that had small amount of blood.  He also reports
decreased PO intake over the past several days secondary to
feeling consipated and bloated.  His last bowel movement was two
days prior to admission. He denies any fever, cough, dyspnea,
chest pain, rash.

Of note, has also been on steroid taper (previously on dex 1 mg
qdaily, now tapered to 0.5mg every other day).

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.7 104 94/54 17 97%RA.
Examination was notable for a distended, tender, non-rigid
abdomen with guarding. Got 100 hydrocortisone, 2L NS, and
Albumin 5% (12.5g / 250mL) x1. Dilaudid 1mg x3 given for pain
control. Bladder scan showed > 800 cc and patient unable to
void; foley placed with 35 cc UOP, likely that bladder saw
ascites not urine. Foley placement verified by ultrasound.
Diagnostic paracentesis performed.  Patient was started on
ceftriaxone 1g, vancomycin 1g, azithromycin 500mg and blood,
urine, ascites cx sent.

On transfer, VS were:
97.2 103 87/57 20 99% 4L

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  98.1, 100, 96/59, 18, 98%

Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59304**] presented to his PCP in [**2100-10-30**] for routine
physical exam and reported he had some left lower quadrant
abdominal discomfort. He was referred to a surgeon for
questionable hernia with CT scan on [**2100-11-18**] revealing a left
kidney mass measuring 9 x 7.5 cm, with a larger exophytic
component measuring approximately 12 cm abutting the abdominal
wall.  He also had periaortic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary
nodules. He was referred here for further management. Plain film
of the left femur was done due to pain, revealing a lytic
lesion. He was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] in orthopedics with plan
for left femur surgery in the future. She obtained plain films
of the right wrist due to pain and another lytic lesion was
noted in the distal ulna. Bone scan on [**2100-12-6**] revealed
widespread bony disease. Zometa was initiated on [**2100-12-7**]. He
underwent open radical left nephrectomy on [**2100-12-17**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3748**]. At the time of surgery, there was significant
progression of disease with extension of tumor into the colon
and mesentery, requiring left colectomy and small bowel
resection. Pathology confirmed renal cell carcinoma, clear cell
histology, [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade 2 with lymphovascular invasion and 4
positive lymph nodes. He underwent excision and curettage of
left distal femur lesion and prophylactic fixation with a
combination of cement, plate, and screws on [**2101-1-5**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**]. He developed increased right wrist pain and was found
to have a pathologic fracture of the distal ulna on [**2101-1-17**]. He
underwent radiation therapy to the right wrist, left shoulder
and left femur at the [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital 5028**] Cancer Center.
Right heel MRI on [**2101-2-28**] demonstrated a metastatic bony lesion
and he received radiation to that site, completing on [**2101-3-18**].
He also had radiation to the left tibia and L3 region. He
developed a pathologic fracture of the left
proximal humerus on [**2101-4-25**], managed with splinting. He was
admitted [**Date range (3) 91600**] with anemia, ascites and disease
progression noted on CT including lung/liver/peritoneam
metastases.

IMAGING
.
Radiology Report RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2101-9-7**] 9:30 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Prior left nephrectomy.  No evidence of hydronephrosis or
renal vascular
occlusion involving the right kidney to explain the patient's
acute renal
failure.
2.  Large amount of ascites with diffuse intraperitoneal
metastatic disease.
.
ECHO [**2101-9-8**] at 9:30:00 AM
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF =
75%) M-mode analysis of the aortic valve suggests premature
systolic closure. A left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
cannot be excluded with certainty due to the technically
suboptimal nature of this study. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2101-9-12**] at 2:20:00 PM
FINAL
Poor image quality.The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are probably normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
CXR 8.9
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly
appeared
moderate left pleural effusion.  There is unchanged evidence of
low lung
volumes and known nodular opacities in both lungs.  No evidence
of pulmonary edema.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
silhouette.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shock: The patient presented with hypotension with systolics
in the 70s-80s compared to his baseline of 120s-130s in the
outpatient setting.  His pressures did not respond adequately to
fluid boluses.  A PICC line was placed and he was started on
dopamine initially.  Dopamine was switched to vasopressin given
concern for his recurrent ascites.  His shock was thought to be
due to a combination of sepsis and intravascular volume
depletion [**3-3**] recurrent malignant ascites. A definitive
infectious source was never identified, though SBP was excluded
with 2 large volume paracenteses. The patient was placed on
vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. He was also given stress dose
steroids. Fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid and
colloid without success. The patient continued to rapidly
reaccumulate fluid in his abdomen. The patient remained oliguric
to anuric during his admission. Norepinephrine was added on the
day of intubation added without improvement in urine output.
After a family meeting, the patient was made CMO and vasoactive
medications were discontinued. The patient expired shortly
thereafter.

# Respiratory failure: The patient developed tachypnea and
increased work of breathing on the morning of his expiration
while undergoing a CT head. He was intubated for respiratory
distress, self-extubated, and was reintubated for continuing
respiratory distress. Versed, fentanyl, and propofol were used
for sedation. A CXR did not show any acute intrapulmonary
process. Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.  An ECHO did
not show any RV strain.  Most likely etiology was worsening lung
function in the setting of extensive RCC lung metastases and
worsening metabolic acidoses due to renal failure.  A family
meeting was held in the afternoon and the decision was made to
make him CMO given his poor prognosis.  The patient was
terminally extubated on the afternoon of [**9-12**] and expired
shortly thereafter.

# Acute renal failure: The patient was oliguric on presentation.
A renal ultrasound did not show impaired renal flow. Bladder
pressures were consistently below 20.  Etiology was likely
secondary to intraarterial volume depletion due to massive 3rd
spacing of fluids secondary to ascites. Urine output did not
improve after large volume paracentesis or after fluid
resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.  Patient became
increasingly acidemic.  Dialysis was discussed and not
considered appropriate given his poor prognosis.

# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient required 2 large
volume paracenteses to manage his malignant ascites. His pain
was managed with a dilaudid PCA.  Patient's outpatient
oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of worsening status and
the decision was made to not be aggressive with interventions
given his worsening prognosis and lack of tumor response to
multiple biologic therapies.

# Comfort care: Patient's Oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
transitioning to comfort care.  As noted above, his prognosis
was poor given his lack of response to biologic therapies.
Palliative care service was consulted.  Patient's family was
called on the day of intubation and arrived in the afternoon.
Discussion was had with the family as well as Oncologist NP and
Palliative care and decision was made to terminally extubate.
Patient expired peacefully in the evening.
