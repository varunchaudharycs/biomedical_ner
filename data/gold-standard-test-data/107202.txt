HPI:

Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for
myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents
with left sided weakness. She reportedly went to bed in her
normal state of health at 2300. Her partner heard her thrashing
in bed at 0130 and at that time, he noted her speech to be
slurred and her left side to be weak, though apparently still
able to move. As it seems that the thrashing likely was around
the time of onset of the stroke, we considered 0130 to be the
last known well time. She was initially taken to OSH, where she
had a CT head that was negative for hemorrhage; it was there
determined that she was "out of the tPA window" and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Full ROS unable to be obtained as patient very agitated and
seemingly confused when providing her own history. However, she
does not appear to have any recent febrile illnesses and there
is
no current chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or
abdominal pain.


Past Medical History:
-HTN
-gout
-hypothyroidism
-myelodysplastic syndrome
-alcohol abuse
-lumbar surgery (exact nature of surgery unknown)


Social History:
She was previously employed as a hairdresser,
though says she hasnt worked in 4 years. Not reported by
patient,
but there is apparently a history of alochol abuse.


Family History:
unknown

CTA head/neck [**1-21**]:
Occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery near its origin.
Likely retrograde collateral flow present, reconstituting more
distal branches of this vascular distribution. Evolving infarct
within the right basal ganglia region.

CT head [**1-21**]:Hyperdense regions within the head of the right
caudate nucleus and right lentiform nucleus. The findings are of
concern for either hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct,
versus extravascular accumulation of contrast material. A
followup MR study may be of help in differentiating between
these two entities.

rpt CT head [**1-22**]:
1. Evolving right basal ganglia hemorrhage with underlying
infarct with
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage and 3 mm leftward
shift.
2. Persistent moderate left subgaleal hematoma, felt to be due
to
anticoagulants on earlier studies- correlate clinically.
3. Paranasal sinus disease.

rpt CT head [**1-23**]:

1. No new foci of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Expected interval evolution of the known right basal ganglia
hemorrhagic conversion, with interval decreased attenuation of
the hyperdense hemorrhagic foci but increase of peri-hemorrhagic
edema.
3. Essentially unchanged mild leftward shift of normally midline
structures, with persistent effacement of the right frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**].
4. Unchanged trace intraventricular hemorrhagic extension at the
right
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] without developing hydrocephalus.
5. Interval decreased soft tissue swelling and hematoma in the
left temporal and frontal region.
6. Paranasal sinus disease as described above.

[**1-26**]: attempted MRI
Incomplete examination due to lack of patient cooperation. Right
basal
ganglia hemorrhage/hematoma is again noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Initial Assessment:

Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for
myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents
with sudden onset left sided weakness. On her exam, her NIHSS is
17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right
gaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect. Her imaging shows
an
occlusion of R MCA near its origin. Her history, exam and
imaging
are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA. The time of
onset was taken to be 0130; the time of her thrashing, and so
when she was seen here, she remained within the window for IV
tPA. The decision was made to proceed with the IV tPA. The plan
at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical
exam
remains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed with
angio for IA tPA vs. Merci.

Neuro:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] was admitted to the neurology ICU, attending Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
There was no improvement with tPA, and she developed hematomas
of the right knee, left scalp, and left clavicular area, so IV
TPA was stopped. The team proceeded with angio and MERCI device
was used. This resulted in opening of inferior division of the
right MCA, but opening of the superior division was
unsuccessful.  She was monitored in the ICU and then was
transferred to the step down unit, then to the floor for further
management. She was started on Aspirin 81mg and Lovenox 40mg
daily (given possible MDS/malignancy.)  Her CT scans showed
hemorrhagic conversion in the Right striatum and white matter.
An MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this.
There was no need to attempt repeating this MRI, per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
stroke attending. Imaging otherwise as above.

CVR:
Blood pressure was controlled metoprolol 25mg TID and as needed
hydralazine.  Her metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID prior to
discharge.  She had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed
no ASD or LV thrombus. There was normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.  There was mild pulmonary
hypertension.  A bubble study was not done.  A transesophageal
echocardiogram was attempted, however Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] developed
methemoglobinemia (level 29) after receiving benzocaine spray.
She received Methylene blue 140mg IV by anesthesia and had rapid
clinical improvement. Her methemoglobinemia level was zero
before returning to the neurology floor.  A transthoracic echo
with bubble was later done which showed No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers.  She had lower extremity doppler
studies which were negative for DVT.  Hypercoagulable work up is
pending at the time of discharge: antithrombin 3, prothrombin
gene mutation, factor v leiden.

Heme: Due to her myelodysplastic syndrome and bleeding with tPA,
heme-onc was consulted, and they did not believe there were any
restrictions on her stroke management due to her MDS.
Additionally, the team spoke with her outpatient hematologist
who confirmed no need for epo or aranesp while in the hospital.
Her HCT was stable during her hospitalization.

FEN/GI: She was initially NPO.  She was followed closely by
speech and language team and was started on NGT feeds.  When
able, a regular diet was initiated and advanced.  At the time of
discharge she was tolerating a regular diet with nectar-thick
liquids.  Her electrolytes were monitored carefully, and
repleted as necessary.
She received Famotidine for GI prophylaxis.

Psych/ETOH:  Initially Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] had significant alcohol
withdrawal.  She was on a CIWA scale and received multiple doses
of Ativan in addition to Valium q12.  She also received thiamine
and folate.  CIWA was discontinued and she had no further
symptoms prior to discharge. She received Trazadone for sleep.

MSK:  Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] had intermittent pain, especially in left
shoulder.  She had an XR which showed no evidence of cortical
disruptions suggestive of fracture or AC separation.  Pain was
treated with tylenol and oxycodone.

-Stroke (Right PCA+MCA-territory infarction)

Secondary diagnoses:
- EtOHism / withdrawal
- chronic LBP
- chronic mild anemia, possible MDS
- methemoglobinemia secondary to benzocaine spray.


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had a large stroke.  You
initially received TPA in attempt to break up the clot in your
brain, however this did not improve your symptoms and you
developed bruising.  You then had a MERCI retrieval which was
able to open up part of your blood vessels.  You were started on
medication, Lovenox, and Aspirin, to prevent further clots and
strokes. You were also started on a blood pressure medication.
You had multiple tests including head CT scans, attempted brain
MRI, echocardiograms, and ultrasounds of your legs to determine
the cause of your stroke.  Additionally, multiple laboratory
tests were sent which are still pending.

While you were in the hospital you were treated for alcohol
withdrawal.  You also developed a reaction to benzocaine spray,
called methemoglobinemia, in which you developed breathing
problems requiring treatment in the ICU.

Followup Instructions:
Provider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**]
Date/Time:[**2135-3-14**] 1:30

The following tests are pending at the time of discharge:
antithrombin 3, factor v leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.
