Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 55 yo male s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant
for AML [**6-/2143**] with chronic GVHD on long-term steroids, DM, hx
of PE on coumadin.
.
He presents to his [**Hospital 3242**] clinic with fatigue for several days, and
anorexia, with about 12-16 hours of worsening shortness of
breath.
.
Endorses increased cough with yellow sputum production and
chills, but no fever. This morning, he reported an acute episode
of dyspnea that did not rapidly improved, and occured with
little amounts of activity and somewhat improved with rest. No
PND/orthopnea. No hemoptysis.
.
He has had no new rashes, and has not had documented fevers. He
has no diarrhea, but has been nauseated without vomiting. He
reports mild epigastric pain. He has a mild headache made
somewhat worse with light, but he feels that this is very
consistent with flares of GVH and not different (has occured he
estimates about 8 times).
.
In clinic SBP 70's, and he was given saline with improvement,
but then the BP decreased down to the 80's. Labs from clinic
showed that Cr increased to 2.9 (baseline 1.1). WBC increased
somewhat. He was transferred to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 4 97.6 72 105/73 18 99%  He was
given total of 3L of saline, and recent vital signs were 98.8
129/85 80 16 96% on 2L at time of transfer. A bedside "shock"
ultrasound US in ED showed no cardiac effusion, no evidence of
gross RV overload. EKG was not significantly changed. Her INR
was 3.0. Of note, he was also complaining of left sided
shoulder/neck pain associated with shortness of breath and
diaphoresis.
.
For interventions, he received 1 gm vanc and 1gm aztreonam, 40
mg medrol, and 2 L IVF in clinic, and another liter in the ED.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-9**] CT chest without contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Mostly resolved parenchymal opacities, leaving several
parenchymal bands which are felt most likely to represent
residua of a prior infectious or inflammatory process.
2. Subacute to chronic rib fractures, including along the right
posterior
seventh rib, where there is faint but suspicious sclerosis
extending further laterally than would usually be expected in
the setting of an uncomplicated rib fracture. In the setting of
prior treated hematological malignancy, the finding of vague
sclerosis raises concern for a bone marrow abnormality such as
myelofibrosis or potentially a form of disease recurrence.
Mostly, however, the bones appear within normal limits.

prior
ultrasound scan [**2145-2-9**]. This has not changed significantly
since prior
ultrasound scan, but followup imaging is advised.
.
[**9-8**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o male with ?viral syndrome vs. other atypical infection
with hypotension that is suspected to be hypovolemia or adrenal
insufficiency, with acute renal failure.
.
# Lethargy: concern for viral syndrome, including activation of
CMV, or a respiratory virus. He has been known EBV+ in the past.
This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has
been having, and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary
work-up in parallel with the infectious work-up. In the ICU,
continued broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin and aztreonam
(given allergy).  Infectious workup largely negative including
CMV VL, respiratory panel, EBV VL, fungal markers, blood
cultures, urine cultures, CT chest. Pt's lethargy improved with
IVFs, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. Did not ever need
pressors.
.
# Dyspnea/Cough: Concern for infectious process. Regarding VTE,
his risk should be reduced with therapeutic INR, though the
concern for coumadin failure merits consideration, though would
be unlikely and he has no other signs and symptoms of DVT. PFTs
completed [**9-9**], with official report pending at time of this
summary. CT chest showing resolving parenchymal processes,
resolving infectious/inflammatory process. Continued broad
spectrum antibiotics initially. When no infiltrate noted on CXR,
decreased ABX to 5 days of azithromycin for treatment of
bronchitis.
.
# Hypotension: A bedside "shock" ultrasound US in ED showed no
cardiac effusion, no evidence of gross RV overload. EKG
unchanged. Patient's hypotension was fluid/stress dose steroids
responsive. Initially given stress dose steroids with plans to
resume home dose.  Also given IVF repletion. BPs normalized.
Likely etiology was slight adrenal insufficiency in setting of
viral syndrome despite negative infectious workup. Patient
discharged with prednisone 7.5 mg daily.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal azotemia. Improved with
IVFs. Cr 0.9 on discharge.
.
# Mild epigastric/RUQ tenderness: No laboratory e/o hepatitis.
RUQ US showing polyp at neck of gallbladder (1.2cm), which was
also seen on prior ultrasound scan [**2145-2-9**]. No other findings
to explain epigastric pain. This pain has resolved on discharge.
.
# Pulmonary Embolism [**11-23**]: continued coumadin with INR goal
[**1-19**].

# Diabetes: Continued NPH 12 units [**Hospital1 **], with close sugar
monitoring and diabetic diet.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, low
blood pressure and acute renal failure. We were concerned for
early sepsis and you were in the ICU initially. You received
broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids, but a full
workup (including viral swabs, cultures, ECHO, and CT chest)
were unrevealing. CT chest showed resolving infiltrates and your
symptoms improved so the antibiotics were switched to
azithromycin for presumed bronchitis. Your prednisone was
increased due to presumed mild adrenal insufficiency.
.
The following medication changes were made:
1) Prednisone increased to 7.5mg daily
2) Azithromycin (antibiotic) started, to be completed as
outpatient
3) Your lisinopril (blood pressure medication) and metoprolol
were discontinued. Do NOT resume these medications until
speaking to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
You need to have your INR checked on Tuesday, [**2145-9-14**]. You also
need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3235**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3236**] within the
next week. Please call their office tomorrow to make this
appointment.
.
of the following symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath,
difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, cough, flu symptoms, or
any other worrisome symptoms.


Followup Instructions:
You need to have your INR checked on Tuesday, [**2145-9-14**].
.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3235**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72254**] office to make an
appointment to be seen later this week. They can be reached at
