Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG, Trach, IR PICC line placeemnt

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19371**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, h/o aortic valve replacement
(St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), PAD s/p bypass surgery and recurrent LE ulcers who
presented to the ED after a cardiac arrest.
.
Per the family, the pt was eating some pureed foods and
complaining of having a choking sensation. The pt's caretaker
was on the phone with the pt's primary care doctor when he
stopped breathing. The caretaker called EMS, and they arrived
within 5 minutes. He was pulseless and apneic, and CPR was
started. He received epinephrine and atropine, and his rhythm
allegedly converted to PEA. He continued to receive CPR, and an
additional round of epinep2hrine and atropine were given, and he
had ROSC. His rhythm was atrial fibrillation with RVR in the
130s.
.
In the ED, he received vancomycin, pip-tazo, 2.5L NS, midazolam,
fentanyl, norepinephrine and was started on the Arctic Sun
therapeutic hypothermia protocol.

Of note, he has been on oral antibiotics for at least the last 3
weeks, most recently a 2-week course of TMP/SMX

STUDIES:

CT HEAD [**2108-2-28**]:
Small vessel ischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy. No

evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large
vascular
territorial infarction.

TTE [**2108-2-28**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive akinesis
involving the apex and anterior septum; there is severe
hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum, and
inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of
unknown acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with
multivessel obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease

EEG [**2108-3-5**]:
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Throughout the recording, the background was one of burst
suppression
alternating between frequent sharp generalized triphasic waves
at a
maximum frequency of 2 Hz to a more suppressed pattern of
suppression of
the background for periods of up to eight seconds alternating
with
bursts of low amplitude activity. In the recent past those
triphasic
appearing waves probably represent short electrographic
seizures.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD who presented with
asystolic cardiac arrest.

# Asystolic arrest: Most likely respiratory arrest. Initially
started on cooling protocol but this was stopped for elevated
INR. Since admission he remained nonresponsive with fixed and
dilated pupils. He was intubated and remained so for the
duration of the hospitalization. Daily spontaneous breathing
trials were negative. Trach was placed and his care was
transitioned to a ventilatory rehab facitlity.

# Hypotension: he was noted to be hypotensive in the ED and was
given IVF and started on pressor support with norepinephrine. He
was waned of this medication and was able to mantain his BP. An
ECHO was obtained showing EF20% hypokinetic LV and PCWP
elevated. This is suggestive of systolic sysfunction and suggest
a cardiac etiology of hypotension. He was gradually weaned off
pressors and maintained a normal BP (90-120 systolic) for
several days. His tamsulosin was held.

# Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and recent
antibiotic use. No evidence of DIC. This was reversed with
vitamin K and FFP. He was then placed on hep gtt when his inr
was subtherapeutic. After the trach and peg he was restarted on
coumadin. He will be bridged back onto coumadin at the
ventilatory rehab center in [**1-3**] days. Goal INR 2.5-3.5.

# h/o [**Date Range 1291**]: on heparin ggt for thrombus ppx. Transition to
warfarin with heparin bridge for 2 days at INR>2.5.

# Neurological disturbances: As noted he was unrespionsive to
verbal and painfull comands. Initially his pupils were fixed and
dilated. He was placed on EEG and a head CT showed small vessel
ischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy. No evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular
territorial infarction. His EEG identified foci of seizure
activity, which occurred with concurrent uncontrolled muscle
movement suggesting a seizure. Neurology followed the paitent.
He was started on Keppra and this was uptitrated to effect (i.e
absence of seizure activity on exam and EEG). During his stay he
exbited some change in neuro exam, in that he was minimally
responsive to pain and pupils more reactive. However this was
very short lasted (one day) and subsequently he was again
nonresponsive.

# Acute renal failure: Initially he was noted to have an
elevated creatinine of 2.1 from 1.o in recent months. Also this
was associated with oligouria. This improved with pressure
support and diuresis, suggestive that the renal failure was
related to decreased forward cardiac output.

# Longitudinal care: Palliative care consult obtained and
several meettings were held with family members and spiritual
leader. Decision to mantain ventilatory support unless evidence
of worsening multiple organ failure.

# Foot Ulceration: Noted severe ulcers on right foot, consistent
with prior documented note by vascular surgery (tendons
exposed). Continued wound care.

# Nutritional support: provided through tube feeds during his
hospitalization. PEG tube placed for future support.

# Complicated UTI: on cefpodoxime (h/o proteus and enterococcus
in urine sensitive to CTX - not cipro). End date [**2108-3-11**].

# Access: PICC was placed for administration of IV medications.


# Indwelling devices: Trach, PEG, PICC
