US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2148-10-14**] 2:33 PM
REPORT: There is a dumb-bell shaped collection in the
gallbladder fossa which contains complex internal echoes. Each
of the limbs of the collection measure approximately 4 cm in
diameter each. The lesion passes close to the stomach
posteriorly but is extragastric.
The liver parenchyma appears normal throughout. No focal hepatic
mass is identified otherwise. No subcapsular lesion is seen.
Status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct measures 7 mm
in maximum dimensions. The right kidney appears normal in size
shape and echotexture.
Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound was performed of the
anastomosed vessels. The hepatic veins appear normal. There
appears to be a clip intimately related to the middle hepatic
vein which appears narrowed at this point. Portal vein is patent
with centrifugal flow. The hepatic arteries have not been
examined.


Brief Hospital Course:

improved and was D/C'd to return to rehab on [**10-15**]
