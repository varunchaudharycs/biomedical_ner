Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2125-9-18**]


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo M with
rheumatic heart disease (c/b aortic stenosis s/p recent [**Known lastname 1291**]/MVR
on [**2125-7-3**]) and atrial fibrillation who presents from his
rehabilitation center with altered mental status.
.
The patient was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic service
from [**2125-7-2**] - [**2125-7-26**] for worsening shortness of breath thought
to be due to worsening AS, MR, and worsening heart failure (EF
40%). He was taken to the OR on [**7-3**] for aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude's valve, aortic endarterectomy, and MVR with a
[**Company 1543**] mosaic tissue valve. His hospital course was
complicated by hypotension requiring pressor support and
eventual failure to extubate due to altered mental
status/encephalopathy and inability to handle secretions. He
received trach and PEG on [**2125-7-17**]. He also received 7 days of
Vancomycin and Cefepime for the secretions (presumably for
emperic treatment of VAP). Of note, he did have some delerium
noted at night -- seroquel was attempted but discontinued due to
somnolence.
He was tolerated trach collar, PM valve, and tube feeds prior to
discharge to [**Hospital6 1293**].
.
His daughter reports that at baseline, he has baseline dementia
but has some baseline cognitive function, including being alert,
interactive, and talkative.  Of note, trach was also removed at
rehab. However, his mental status at rehab has been waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] during his rehab stay (documented in multiple
cardiothoracic NP[**MD Number(3) 29639**] as having confusion at rehab
occasionally requiring restraints and wandering), but noted by
his dtr to be worsening over the past week since he was
transferred to a new [**Hospital1 1501**]. He has had episodes of jerking
movements of his fingers or a 'kick' of the legs.
Independently, he also has episodes of lethargy, where he falls
"asleep" mid-sentence, is unresponsive to tactile or verbal
stimuli, then returns to his baseline but appears
drowsy/confused. These unresponsive episodes were occurring [**2-28**]
times a day, but were also increasing in frequency during the
week prior to admission. Haldol and Trazodone have been
attempted at rehab without good effect and were discontinued due
the drowsiness as well as (per ED report) some symptoms of lip
smacking that were thought to be [**2-27**] tardive dyskinesia. He was
originally discharged on tube feeds, but per report has been
tolerating a PO diet. He was brought into the ED today for
further evaluation of these symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 90 130/102 18 99% on room air
Patient was given ativan 2 mg IV x1, Vancomyin 1 gram IV x1,
CFTX 2 grams IV x1, and Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x1. Labs
significant for a WBC of 14.0, ALT of 41, AST of 47, INR of 3.8,
and chemistries WNL. No formal ABG performed, but pH noted to be
7.40 at 4:46 PM. He was noted multiple times by the ED
attendings and residents to have multiple (>3) lethargic
episodes and multiple episodes of myoclonic jerks. The patient
would be responsive afterwards, but somewhat confused per
report, stating he was 'in Brookline'. He got 2 mg of Ativan for
presumed seizure activity and became unresponsive with slight
desaturation requiring BiPAP. Neurology was consulted in the ED
and thought the patient was having myoclonic
jerks/encephalopathy, but exam was clouded by recently receiving
Ativan. Head CT with no acute intracranial process. CTA
demonstrated no PE, LLL aspiration pneumonitis, and a stable
AAA. He was initially going to be taken onto the neurology
service, but due to concern for his unresponsiveness and
possible respiratory compromise, he was admitted to the MICU for
further monitoring.  His VS were afebrile 110 25 125/86 100% on
NRB prior to transfer.
.
On the floor,  the patient is lethargic and minimally responsive
to vocal or tactile stimuli. IV metoprolol 5 mg q5 min given
upon admission to the floor for AF w/ RVR.

.
ECG [**2125-9-12**]: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of
110. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left axis
deviation with probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2125-7-3**] multiple abnormalities as
previously noted persist without major change.
.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2125-9-12**]: No acute intracranial process.
Low-attenuating lesions in the periventricular white matter,
most likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.
.
Chest CTA [**2125-9-12**]: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with
perifissural consolidation/atelectasis. Peribronchovascular
thickening extending into the posterior segment to the left
lower lobe is concerning for aspiration.
2. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm. Stable dilation of the
aortic arch as
well as the distal aspect of the thoracic aorta. 3. Cardiomegaly
with biatrial enlargement. 4. No pulmonary embolism.
.
[**Month/Day/Year 5283**] US [**2125-9-13**]: 1. No evidence of cholecystitis or biliary
obstruction.
2. Bilateral, right greater than left small pleural effusions.
3. Multiple bilateral renal cyst again seen.
.
TTE [**2125-9-14**]:The right atrium is moderately dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened.
The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen, but current study cannot
exclude prosthetic valve endocarditis. Depressed left
ventricular systolic function.
.
TEE [**2125-9-18**]: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function
appears depressed. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The prosthetic mitral leaflets appear normal. The
transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations
seen. Normally-functioning bioprosthetic aortic and mitral
valves.

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo male with history of rheumatic heart disease s/p St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1525**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] and tissue MVR in [**6-/2125**], afib on coumadin, and systolic
heart failure who presented to ED from rehab with
lethargy/altered mental status.

#. Respiratory Failure: Patient developed acute hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to lorazepam administration in ED.
 He was transferred to ICU for further care, but did not require
intubation. He has severe OSA, and was seen by sleep medicine
while in ICU. Unable to complete study as patient could not
tolerate BiPAP, but patient will need sleep medicine follow-up
and repeat sleep study as outpatient.  The patient's respiratory
status improved, and he was stable for transfer to the floor on
[**2125-9-14**]. The patient was unable to tolerate CPAP, and therefore
was kept on oxygen via nasal cannula at night.  He was not given
any further sedating medications except in the setting of his
TEE.  All sedating meds in the outpatient setting should be
avoided or minimized as possible.
.
#. Enterococcal bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn on admission
positive for enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin and ampicilin.
 He was initially on vancomycin, then switched to
ampicillin/gentamicin per ID consult recommendations.  He
required ampicillin desensitization in ICU setting given his h/o
penicillin allergy. A TEE on [**2125-9-18**] did not reveal the presence
of any valvular vegetations. However, per ID recs the patient
should still complete a course of antibiotics that would treat
endocarditis, especially given his [**Date Range 1291**]/MVR. CT surgery was
following, and there was no need for surgical intervention given
the TEE findings.  The patient will be on ampicillin until
[**2125-10-28**], and gentamicin for synergy until [**2125-9-29**]. He had a PICC
placed on [**2125-9-19**] for continued antibiotic therapy. All
surveillance blood cultures drawn since [**2125-9-12**] were negative to
date at time of discharge.  The patient remained afebrile and
was hemodynamically stable.
.
#. Altered mental status: The patient was found to have
enterococcal bacteremia, and delirium in setting of infection
was likely the primary contributing factor to his altered mental
status.  Also probable contributing factors include chronic CO2
retention, severe OSA, medication effects, and prolonged
hospital course.  Head CT on admission did not show any acute
intracranial process. No other source of infection, including
PNA or UTI, was identified. At time of discharge, patient's
mental status continued to wax and wane. He was oriented to
person and place, and able to follow some commands.
.
#. s/p St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] and tissue MVR: Given valves, goal INR is
2.5-3.5. The patient's INR was trended and coumadin dose was
adjusted accordingly. Coumadin held for period in setting of
supratherapeutic INR, then restarted. INR was also briefly
subtherapeutic, and patient was placed on heparin gtt during
this time to bridge back to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.  INR
was at goal (2.5) on day of discharge, and heparin gtt had been
stopped. INR should continue to be monitored, and coumadin dose
adjusted accordinly. As above, no evidence of valvular
vegetations was seen on TEE [**2125-9-18**].
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient's home dose of metoprolol was
titrated up to 100mg PO TID, given frequent episodes of
tachycardia to 120s. Patient was asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable during these episodes.  He was continued
on coumadin as above for both his a fib and [**Month/Day/Year 1291**]/MVR.
.
#. Chronic systolic heart failure: TTE on [**2125-9-14**] showed LVEF of
30-35%. Patient appeared euvolemic for much of hospital course.
He was on furosemide 20mg daily prior to admission, and this
medication should be restarted in outpatient setting if patient
develops hypervolemia and pulmonary edema. Patient was continued
on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker. Lisinopril dose is currently
5mg daily, this can be up-titrated if BP will allow in
outpatient setting.
.
#. Hypertension:  The patient was continued on metoprolol,
lisinopril as above. Furosemide may be restarted as outpatient
if patient develops hypervolemia or becomes more hypertensive.
.
#. Hyperlidipemia: The patient was on simvastatin 10mg daily
prior to admission, and this was re-started prior to discharge.
This medication was briefly held in setting of elevated
transaminases, however was resumed as transaminases trended down
to normal levels. Etiology of elevation in transaminases
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 5283**] US on [**2125-9-13**] was unremarkable.
.
#. Nutrition: Patient has PEG tube in place, but has not been
using since prior to admission. He is able to tolerate PO
intake, but should be monitored on aspiration precautions.
