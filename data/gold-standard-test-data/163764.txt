Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
elective catheterization with aspirin desentization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
58 yo white male w/ h/o CAD s/p catheterization in 3/99 who now
presnts for aspirin desentization and repeat cath s/p positive
MIBI study. Pt presented with CP in 3/99 and had angioplasty of
80% stenosed RCA (vessel too small for stents) and states 6
months afterwards he had the same vessel angioplastied again.
States since then he has felt well up until 6 months ago when he
began having CP again. C/o SSCP that comes on when he walks
about a block. States the pain only lasts a few minutes and
accompanied by SOB but no N/V/diaphoresis. No radiation. Pain
resolves if he stops to rest. States he does not take SL Nitro
b/c the pain resolves on its own. He had a stress test [**2200-5-27**]
which showed mild to moderate, partially reversible myocardial
perfusion defects involving the anterior wall, apex, and septum,
with transient ischemic dilatation of the LV and global
hypokinesis (LVEF 30%). Pt now returns for repeat cath.
     Pt states approx 25 years ago he took an aspirin and
shortly after developed hives and profuse vomiting. Since then
he has not tried to take aspirin again. He is now admitted for
aspirin desensitization before catheterization.

Past Medical History:

drug use.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2200-8-26**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system. The
LMCA was angiographically normal. The LAD had a 50% lesion after
the
takeoff of D1. The D1 had a 60% lesion proximally. The LCX had a
50%
lesion after the high OM1 (which bifurcates). The RCA has
diffuse
irregularities, which are <50%.
2. Limited hemodynamics on entry show mildly elevated left-sided
filling
pressures (LVEDP 20 mm Hg).
3. Left ventriculography showed a globally hypokinetic ventricle
with a
LVEF of 26%. There was no gradient across the LV on pullback.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction. Mild diastolic
ventricular
dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo M with h/o CAD s/p angioplasty in '[**94**] who now returns for
repeat cath and aspirin desentization.
1. CV:
A. CAD - Continue Plavix, Lipitor, Metoprolol, Lisinopril. H/o
aspirin allergy - pt underwent aspirin desensitization the night
before his catheterization. He tolerated the protocol well with
no complications. Similarly, his catheterization was tolerated
well with no complications and it was felt that the pt has
diffusely mild disease that did not require intervention at this
time. After the procedure the pt's groin had good hemostasis. No
hematomas were found.
B. HTN - continue Imdur, Norvasc, Metoprolol, Lisinopril.
2. Endo: continue Levoxyl.
3. PPX: on protonix.
4. Dispo: Pt remained in the MICU the night before his
catheterization and was stable after the procedure and was sent
home with followup instructions.
