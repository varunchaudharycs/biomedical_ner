History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 F with HTN, + FH of early CAD, + smoker and
little recent medical care transferred from CMI service
following cath yesterday. Up until last month, she had had no
medical followup. She recently decided to have cataract surgery
and the following events occurred as a result of preop workup.
She has had at least a two year history of gradually worsening
exertional angina and dyspnea on exertion but never sought
medical attention. Symptoms also occured with times of emotional
stress. She initially attributed her symptoms to stress and
anxiety. Over the last couple months, her exertional chest pain
sometimes took hours before going away (initially responded
quickly to rest). Symptoms (CP and dyspnea) also occurring at
rest with minor emotional stressors.
.
She had persantine MIBI on [**2108-10-18**] which showed possible mild
lateral wall ischemia. She also developed hypertension to
210/120 during stress and required presentation to OSH ED. She
was started on an antihypertensive regimen with prn SLNTG. In
the two weeks PTA she has taken at least 5 per day.
.
She was admitted for cath yesterday. Found to have 99% LCx
lesion that could not be stented. Also had disease of RCA, LAD
(see below). Got Plavix 600 x 1 pre cath. Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **]
consulted; plan for CABG after Plavix washout.
.
Following cath started on heparin gtt (since continued mild CP
and ST depressions/TWI in lateral leads). Also has been on nitro
gtt for CP. Reports CP during cardiac cath; following this has
had intermittent 0.5-1/10 CP with one increase to [**8-7**] last
night, responsive to increase in nitro gtt. Reports severe
anxiety, relieved by benzos.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, black stools or
red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Initial EKG ([**11-12**] AM) demonstrated NSR at 97, normal
axis/intervals, ST depressions V4-V6, I; TWI aVL. ECG [**11-13**] AM
(during CP) also with NSR at 76, lateral ST depressions and TWI
(V5, V6, I, aVL).
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2108-11-13**] demonstrated: Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest (likely due to a
hyperdynamic LV function).
.
ETT performed on [**2108-10-18**] demonstrated: + chest and jaw pain with
hypertension to 210/120; imaging showing ?mild lateral wall
ischemia vs. artifact.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2108-11-12**] demonstrated: 99% mid LCx
lesion (failed attempt to stent), 100% OM1 and 90% OM2; 50% mid
LAD and 80% D1 (also aneurysmal); 60% mid RCA. Patent renals. 3
cm infrarenal AAA.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2108-11-20**] 12:21 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**11-18**], the small apical
pneumothorax appears to be even less than on the previous study.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**11-16**] where she underwent
a CABG x4. She was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition. She was extuabted later that same day. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #1. She developed a small left
apical pneumothorax after her chest tubes were pulled that
remained stable on subsequent chest xray. She also developed a
pruritic generalized  rash for which her lasix was discontinued
and she was treated with sarna lotion. She otherwise did well
postoperatively and was ready for discharge home on POD #4.
