Brief Hospital Course:
[**2-6**] HD #1  Admitted to the Trauma service. His scalp laceration
was sutured. He underwent CT imaging which showed bilateral rib
fractures, sternal fracture, pulmonary contusion and C7 pedicle
fracture with possible ligamentous injury at C3-C4.  Seen and
evaluated by Neurosurgery who recommended non operative
intervention with use of a c-collar with thoracic extension
([**Location (un) 36323**] brace).

[**2-7**] HD #2 Seen by the acute pain service because of his rib
fractures. An epidural catheter was placed (Dilaudid)for pain
control. His diet was slowly advanced.

[**2-8**] HD #3 He was transferred to the floor. Tolerating his
diabetic diet. Pain controlled, pulmonary hygiene continues.  He
was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for low Hct; post transfusion Hct
28.1.  Seen and evaluated by PT & OT, they have recommended
short term rehab to improve overall functioning.

[**2-9**] HD #4 In the evening, when the RN was cleaning under the
brace, the patient refused to have the brace replaced. He became
increasingly agitated and a psych emergency was called. Episode
was felt to be related to delirium per Psychiatry who was
consulted, caused by sedatives that patient had previously
received during the acute hospital phase. He subsequently was
placed on sitters; sedatives were stopped. His behavior improved
significantly and the sitters were able to be discontinued.

[**2-10**] HD#5 His brace was adjusted by the Orthotics company for a
more comfortable fit. [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was also consulted
due to elevated blood sugars; glargine added and his sliding
scale was adjusted.  Epidural catheter discontinued and he was
transitioned to oral pain medications. Ho pain overall was in
much better control at this time.

[**2-11**] HD#6 Pt continu ed to improve, pt made aware of importance
of keeping brace on, and patient agreed, via russian translator,
to do so.  Sitter d/c'd in preparation for rehab.

[**2-12**]  HD#7 Pt cleared for discharge to rehab with brace.  Follow
up instructions discussed with patient.  Need to keep brace on
discussed with patient.  Patient agrees to plan anf follow up.
