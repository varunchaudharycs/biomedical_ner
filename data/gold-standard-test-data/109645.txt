discharged back to [**Hospital1 1680**] and then represented to ED in PM of
[**8-11**] for concern for delerium tremens.
Per [**Hospital **] rehab records, pt's last drink was reportedly on
Sunday, [**8-9**]. He was sectioned to [**Hospital1 1680**] on [**8-10**] for rehab.
Initial ED course: 98.6 HR: 67 BP: 104/70 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 96%

visual hallucinations which he could bring on by closing his
eyes. Labs significant for cr of 1.8, K 2.9, AG 15, CBC with
crit 32.4, wbc 5.9, plt 111. He was given 60mEq of K+ and given
valium. As per ED attending discharge, "The patient is not
actively withdrawing
from alcohol the emergency department as he has a CIWA scale
less than 10." He was discharged back to [**Hospital1 1680**] detox.
This afternoon, while back at [**Hospital1 1680**], he became more ataxic,
confused and aggressive and combative towards staff and was
subsequently brought back to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for re-evaluation of etoh
w/drawal. While at [**Hospital1 1680**], he apparently had two witnessed falls
without head trauma or LOC. Per nurse manager at [**Hospital1 1680**], he also
urinated on the floor and had one episode of NBNB vomiting 24hrs
prior to presentation in ED.
Second ED course: T97.8 P98 BP110/75 RR18 O2:98% RA. As per EMS,
orthostatics were checked and negative. He was reportedly
combative and confused but PE was unremarkable for any focal
neurologic findings with the exception of ataxia. He had no
stigmata of chronic liver disease and per hx obtained through
staff at [**Name (NI) 1680**], pt did not have any complaints of abdominal
pain, diarrhea, cough, headache, fever, chills.
Pt was given 5mg haldol and 2mg IV ativan. Labs were significant
for improved chem 7 with K now 3.5, and cr now 1.0. AG had
resolved. Mg was 1.3 and Ca 8.3. CBC grossly unchanged from
earlier in the day. Head CT without any acute findings.
EKG x2 revealed leftward axis deviation but otherwise
unremarkable.
While in the [**Name (NI) **] pt did not have any significant acid-base or
electrolyte disturbances, no hemodynamic or respiratory
instability, hyperthermia, tremors or tachycardia. As per
nursing signout, his CIWA score was 5 at time of transfer.

Imaging:
[**2116-8-11**] CXR PA/lat: Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with
crowding of bronchovascular markings.  Cardiac silhouette is
accentuated by low lung volumes. Thoracic aorta is quite
tortuous and may be enlarged in ascending or descending
portions. Clinical correlation is indicated to see if
imaging is indicated.  No acute focal consolidation, pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax.

[**2116-8-11**] non-contrast CT head: There is no evidence for acute
intracranial hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or
hydrocephalus.  There is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation.  The basal cisterns appear patent.  Prominent
ventricles and sulci suggest age-related involutional changes.
Note is made of a persistent cavum septum pellucidum.  The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells appear well aerated.  No acute bony abnormality is
detected.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 M with PMH EtOH abuse, IBS and depression,
admitted from [**Hospital1 1680**] for management of EtOH withdrawal and
concern for [**Hospital 90022**] hospital course complicated by [**Last Name (un) **].

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Alcohol withdrawal, concern for DTs, Adverse Drug Reaction
- Patient was agitated on arrival and ataxic and there was
concern that he was going into DTs, despite being on librium at
the detox facility. In the ED he received 5mg Haldol for acute
agitation.  He was admitted to the MICU for management of
withdrawal and close monitoring. He was not tachycardic or
hypertensive. In the MICU, he was treated with diazepam per CIWA
scale (most recently [**Doctor Last Name **] ~5), as well as thiamine and folate
(recently transitioned to PO). Non-contrast head CT (for eval
given falls) showed no ICH.  After transfer to the floor,
patient was calm and appropriate, with little memory of what had
brought him to the hospital; he felt that his what had been
described to him was not consistent with his character.
Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate whether bizarre behavior at
[**Hospital1 1680**] may have had an alternative explanation.  Consult
theorized that patient's presentation was more consistent with
benzodiazepene intoxication than alcohol withdrawal.

# Acute Renal Failure due to Dehydration:
Initial Cr was 1.8, but improved to 1.0 on second chem panel
without any intervention.

CHRONIC:
# Depression:
Patient reported history of depression, which was impetus for
him to resume excess alcohol consumption.  He denied depression
during this admission.  He was provided with resources by SW.
Psychiatry evaluation was performed who felt he was completely
safe to discharge, and was not particularly depressed at this
time. No SI/HI.

# thrombocytopenia/Anemia:
likely EtOH induced marrow suppression given h/o etoh abuse,
elevated MCV. Stable throughout admission

# Benign Hypertension:
No acute exacerbation of chronic issue, pt. was continued on
home dose of amlodipine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Caution with benzodiazepenes during withdrawal.
# Recommended to have close follow up for depression.

Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
from [**Hospital 1680**] Hospital for concern that you were behaving
abnormally. You were treated for alcohol withdrawal, which may
have contributed to your symptoms. You were given
benzodiazepines, intravenous fluid and vitamin supplementation.
During this hospitalization, you returned to behaving like your
normal self. You were seen by the psychiatry team who believe
that your abnormal behavior may also have been in part due to
side effects from the medication used to treat your alcohol
withdrawal.

You complained of anxiety while in the hospital. We have given
you a 3 day prescription for an anti-anxiety medication to treat
your symptoms until you can see your primary care physician who
will take over management of your anxiety.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
START-lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 mg by mouth as needed for anxiety,
up to one every 8 hours.
